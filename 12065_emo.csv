""Will I be good enough?""

""was my passing the exam just a fluke?""

""I'm going to fail horribly and will become an embarrassment to the profession.""

""I feel bad that I might have taken the spot of someone more deserving of the title.""

2270,"I love my kids and wife. I love being the best dad and husband I can be, but I never want them to acknowledge the day.

If they really *have* to do something, i ask them to get me a card. That’s enough.

Yesterday however, I got cards, new sneakers and taken out for brunch.

This was all very kind of them, but I felt terrible - it feels like it’s a day that tells people “do something for your dad!” And people do it without me earning it.

I know that on that same day, terrible, abusive dads are getting the same treatment as me. So what’s the point?

I’m more than happy to just ignore it.

But then, I feel exactly the same about my birthday. Why make a fuss? I did nothing to earn it, I tell no one, make sure I’m working that day and feel horribly guilty if my family make a fuss of me.

Does this sound like Imposter Syndrome to you guys?",anger
2271,"just finished my freshman year as an international student at one of the top US colleges for my major. i got a research opportunity my second semester here in the field that i hope to go into in the future (tbf the lab likes to accept young students bc theyre more likely to stay longer vs graduating halfway through their project). i managed to maintain a good gpa and made a good connection that led to another opportunity within sci comm and possibly a TA- adjacent position with this professor 

but i still feel like an imposter. i still feel like at any day i’ll lose all of this. i think research has been one of the biggest sources of my imposter syndrome as a college student. before anyone says that i’m in a toxic lab or have a bad grad student that’s definitely not the case. my research is in a topic that i never had an official education about or even covered the basic background science (talking bare minimum stuff) due to my educational background. this led my o me lacking a lot of the basic knowledge, on top of the obvious of not knowing the detailed stuff. i spend so much time trying to understand this stuff but it feels like it never sticks. I don't know if im using this as an excuse or if it's real but I have really bad brain fog and it's gotten worse as my academically challenging institution was academically challenging lol. I always felt like I was behind in comparison to the other undergrads, they always sounded smart and knew what they were talking about and were taking advanced classes even though we're the same year. this kinda led me to spending a lot of time in lab to “compensate”. towards the end of the semester i initiated a conversation w my grad student telling her I feel like I haven't made enough progress in my project and she said she's more concerned about my understanding of conceptual stuff. I think this is still a persisting issue and she kind of implied it the last time we talked. sure she said “you're smart ik yk this”, at the end of the conversation she gave me feedback and I'm fine with that feedback and it's totally valid but it just reminded me of the first one. this “imposter syndrome episode” also came in a bad time. 

my mom is sick with a big time zone difference and many many hours to get to her’ and even then it’s not an option because life. my confidence is shook because i’ve been making insanely many mistakes in lab, which didn’t happen my first semester. im not sleeping and struggling to eat, im pmsing and all of this is piling up to make me feel so weak. 

I know I'm fucking amazing and I achieved so much considering my background, but sometimes I feel like I'm not fit for this, lately I've been thinking a lot about whether I'm just not cut out for it and it's better to stop or and explore something else. I love my work so much and I'm not done with this I haven't learned everything I can learn but I just feel like I'm stuck in a loop of not feeling enough, busting my ass of studying outside lab and spending 15+ hours a week, and getting feedback that I'm not _there_ yet.

I've been thinking about bringing this up with my grad student/ professor but I don't know if that's a good idea and I'm just thinking about this affects my image. I'm definitely not going to do this right now because I've been so emotional for the past few weeks and I need to decide this whenim in a better mindset, but this is really starting to get to me. I was originally planning on doing research until I graduate buy I don't know if I should anymore",anticipation

2274,"Hi everyone!

I've  been on a journey to improve my mental well-being and develop healthier thought patterns. Over the past year, I've faced challenges with  anxiety and found it difficult to break out of negative thought cycles. A. I  tried mindfulness exercises, but however hard I tried, I couldn't shut  off my thoughts. That's why I started looking for a different approach. That's when I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I started  challenging my unrealistic thoughts and learned how to react to them in a  more reasonable way.

However, doing this on your own, instead of with a therapist, is difficult. Even if you have a therapist, you only get help once a week instead of every time you are struggling with negative thoughts. So, I took matters  into my own hands and developed an app to make the process more  accessible and user-friendly. Here's how the app works:

1. Write a note whenever you find yourself overwhelmed by unhelpful thoughts.
2. The app analyzes your note, identifying common cognitive distortions.
3. Receive personalized suggestions to challenge and reframe your thoughts.

I've already got a couple hundred users and great feedback but I feel like imposter syndrome is basically the definition of distorted thinking, so I thought this might help a lot of you fighting imposter syndrome, and help me tailor the apps to your needs. The app is available as a beta on iOS and Android. 

If you're interested in trying it out and sharing your thoughts, please leave a comment or send me a direct message or join the Discord community where you can find all links you need: [https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3](https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3)

I am looking forward to hearing your input! 😊

2275,I have it by monthly Suboxone doctor appointment and today I have a substitute because my doctors having a baby. I'm almost always in about 15 minutes early before my appointment and this time I should have a half hour early today to meet with the counselor before I meet with the doctor those of you who are in a suboxone clinic I understand this. Anyhow they've moved this new doctor to an entire different part of the building and it's now been 30 minutes past my appointment and I've only got an hour to get to the pharmacy downtown that closes early. I'm saying an hour after I spend 30 minutes talking to a doctor here. If I don't catch the buses just right I am going to be completely screwed cuz I will not be able to pick up my medications and they're closed on the weekend. This is a couple pictures of the clinic I go to in Durham. I guess it's worth it to get four suboxones a day. These days I'm only taking it too so I'm stashing the rest for later. I'm okay with keeping 60 around every month for a year.

2276,"I'm a 16 year old high school student in Arizona, about to enter my senior year, and I feel so far behind my peers. I feel I'm way too hard on myself, as I currently work a job and I'm ranked #5 in weighted GPA at my high school with a 4.209. That should be enough, right? Although I've tried to tell myself that I've done enough already, I couldn't feel more like a fraud. There are so many points that I could consider when telling myself I am who everyone thinks I am, but my mind comes up with very convincing counterpoints. For example, I achieved the highest ACT score of my class, where it was mandatory for all juniors to take the ACT, yet it was just a 31. Considering a 31 is the BEST ACT score IN THE JUNIOR CLASS, it makes me feel like I'm going to a school of very low academic achievement. This leads into my next point. I was just elected the president of my school's National Honors Society, but I don't feel I deserve it. The members are all extremely lazy, but I hope that changes in Senior year. I have quite a few ideas for improvements we can make to the club next year, but the running was a complete joke. In fact, I was the only student to even run for president, and I've only ever been to one event we held as a club (We''ve only ever had around 4. It was a super bad year for us.) and I hadn't even been to all of the meetings. On top of this, my SAT score is a little disappointing to me. I got a 1410. And I really don't mean for this to sound like a troll post, this is just what my brain keeps telling me. And I understand that in writing this sounds ridiculous, but it's just so rough. I wish I had done more extracurriculars while I could. I haven't done a single sport or other club save NHS and a few days of robotics club at the end of Junior year. This problem really has me considering my future, and fearing I'm going to be a failure. I feel like my GPA means nothing, especially being from one of the lowest ranked states as far as academics go. This is really just a vent post, as I understand it may sound ridiculous, but I just feel like I don't deserve any of the stuff I have, like I've just been really lucky to get good test scores but in reality I'm super unintelligent. I feel like a fraud.",trust
2277,"I am currently 30 years old and I have come to the realization that I severe imposter syndrome and that is the reason I have been so stuck in my life.

Background: I grew up in a Salvadoran household in NYC/Dallas, TX. My household was extremely violent because of my father. There are many stories of the extreme violence I encountered in my own house but that would take up too much writing. I already started to feel insecure in how people viewed me and my family because of this so I already started to develop a feeling of being “less than”, at a very young age. 

My father was over protective and violent with my siblings and I, so that sometimes translated in social interactions. I can’t tell you the amount of embarrassing moments I had in my life because I was literally ignorant and it was something I should have been taught. I always lacked discipline and consistency throughout my whole life. Those moments really fucked up my self esteem even more. 

I have always felt insecure about my literacy level both in English and Spanish, which, I feel, is common among children of immigrant parents. I never felt that I was smart enough to use more advanced vocabulary in my everyday conversations and, if I did, I would feel like fraud or poser for using it. I carried that with me my whole life. 

At the age of 13, I started to realize that I was different. I grew up in a Christian church and the LGBTQIA+ was always being talked about. Growing in a Latino household, there was a bunch of homophobic comments, jokes, etc. And i attended a Christian university. 😭 So all of those experiences made it very difficult to accept that I was gay which added to my insecurities. 

All these experiences really started to affect me on another level while I was in college, which I think is when most people start experiencing imposter syndrome. I was studying music, vocal performance. Which is a horrible degree for someone who gets anxiety from people judging you. Throughout my whole college career, I didn’t feel good enough about anything I did. Literally. I didn’t feel talented enough. Smart enough. Good enough. 
I knew I was gay but felt like I needed to control my every move and hide it as much as I could and wanted it to go away. 

After graduating the only thing I got better at had to do with sexuality. I came out to people and all but the other stuff stayed with me. It was so hard for me to find a stable job because my interviews were so terrible because I had severe anxiety for my interview. Sweating like crazy and all. Over thought my answers. I didn’t feel at the same level of the persons interviewing me. I never felt good enough for a white collar job sometimes I still don’t because of my past. I didn’t pursue anything in music because I always felt like I wasn’t good enough and felt like a fraud for calling myself a musician. 

Eventually, I got a job with my brother doing concrete polishing. Which made me comfortable because I didn’t have to work through those traumas that really play into my imposter syndrome. Fast forward to 2021. I got a job that was unionized so I was excited because of all the perks but even there my IS showed up. I didn’t want to lose my job so my anxiety was through the roof. Overthought everything. Always felt like I was going to lose my job. Felt like I needed to be perfect in everything.

I started doing side work with my brother again and it was time for me to start teaching the new workers the skill because I have done it for 7 years. That made them view me as someone who can advise them on the job and I felt so weird to be seen in that position and wrong lol. 

These past few months I have been having a breakthrough. I feel today I can walk in a room and be the most confident I could ever be even if I don’t get the result I want because honestly it will be alright. 

Sorry for the long post and if it doesn’t make sense. This is the first time I have expressed these feelings in its entirety.",trust
2278,"Maybe it’s just been a rough week but I just feel like I’m not cut out to be a tax accountant.

Long story short - I graduated college at the end of 2019 and started my first accounting job out of college at a really small firm, with no previous experience. I prepared mostly personal taxes, a few 1120s and 1065s, and was also involved in bookkeeping. There was minimal training and I really learned what I could from asking questions and just doing the work. I was with them for over 2 1/2 years but decided to leave due to off season stress of not having enough work (if I had no work they wouldn’t let me study for my CPA either) and the fact I didn’t see myself being promoted anytime soon (I was the only staff for a good 6 months towards the end).

I decided to go to a mid level firm and accepted a staff roll. I’ve loved it so far and love all the opportunities I’m being given to work on bigger clients and focus on my weaker areas. However, I feel like coming in with 2 1/2 years I didn’t expect to have such a learning curve (I definitely knew I would come in with less experience in certain areas) Coming from a state with no income tax, working on mostly individuals, and having no actual formal training other than just on the job has put me at a disadvantage. I feel so dumb compared to other staff. I’ve been put on large clients with multi-state returns, and many things I haven’t seen before (Which I’ve disclosed). I’ve tried my best to learn; but everything takes me longer, I’m still perfecting and trying to make my work papers clean, and I feel like I‘m not doing good enough :( During engagement meetings I try and take very detailed notes - but I feel like I always miss something. Or my work papers aren’t done quite the right way for the reviewer - or I just misunderstand what should be done. I want to ask more questions, but I either feel too stupid or don’t know what to ask (Like I think I do understand something - when in reality I don’t) Most of the smaller returns I've worked  on I’ve gotten good feedback on. I haven’t gotten any bad feedback so far - I can just know that it takes a lot more patience to work with me on bigger projects/ returns right now and certain reviewers probably get frustrated with me. I’ve started to get anxiety while I’m working again and I don’t feel like I’m meeting expectations. I don’t feel like I can turn down work since I still am trying to prove myself and work with a variety of people - I’ve taken maybe 2 actual days of PTO since busy season ended and I’m just feeling stressed. I’m just trying to keep pushing through knowing that maybe there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s so frustrating after being in accounting as a staff for almost 3 1/2 years to feel this way, is accounting even what I want to pursue? Will I ever get better? I really want to be a CPA but I just feel like I’m too stupid. I feel like all my friends are getting promoted and doing amazing and their jobs just love them. I’m 25 and I just don’t feel like I’m ever going to be successful :( 

It’s been a rough year for me with personal tragedy occurring in the middle of busy season as well. I’m in therapy to work on managing my busy schedule (both personally and at work) as well as work through some childhood trauma. I definitely feel like my personal issues during busy season did affect my work and motivation - but I’m trying to get back into it and I just don’t feel like I’m doing enough.",trust

2283,"I’m so beyond grateful for the support of my family, friends, and boyfriend and their words of congratulations to me. A small part of me thinks “yeah I did that, I accomplished it,” but the bigger part of me doesn’t know why I feel nothing.

My time as a piano major was extremely stressful, not in the academic way but in a personal way that was tied to my professors. After graduating from my two year college, my private instructor there cut me off completely. It was confusing because we were so close, she was someone I told everything to. My last conversation with her, I revealed to her that my sister was taken by CPS and I was diagnosed with RA. I tried to follow up with her but she never responded. I don’t resent her for it, I’m still very confused and hurt that after 2-3 years of talking to her almost everyday, she refused to say hello or even ask how I was doing after transferring to university.

Almost immediately after moving away from family to continue my studies, I learned about my sister and CPS and it impacted my ability to focus or perform, which is huge since I was literally a performance major and I was performing every week. I thought I had gained trust with one of my piano professors, so I told him what was going on. He was so supportive until my last day of class when he told me how disappointed he was in my final class performance but that he would still give me an A out of pity for me. That should’ve made me feel grateful but I felt so humiliated. In my last year at university, my new private lesson instructor made me feel like I had learned nothing while at school, saying I wouldn’t pass my recital hearing (basically a test to see if I’m ready to perform my senior recital) and even threatening my graduation date. He would also say things like “you haven’t made any progress” but in the same breath tell me I’ve come a long way, which confused me. Small things like that added up to an entire list, most of which is made up of negative commentary.

Now I’m not going to pretend like I deserve only praise. I’m well aware that I’m not a prodigy and that I’m not going to make a career out of performing because it’s not something I feel I have the constitution for. Sure, I enjoy the occasional performance especially in front of audiences that are supportive and want to hear what I have to share. I actually just had my debut in Colombia in April where I got to teach a masterclass and then perform in the concert hall in front of 500 people. They were so incredibly kind and they are still reaching out to me to tell me how much they loved hearing me play.

So why, after seeing my own progress and being happy with how I progressed, especially as someone in a field where there are so many incredible and inspiring musicians, do I feel like I didn’t do what I was supposed to? I used to be so proud of the music I shared because I genuinely felt like I was meant to do this, but then hearing these professors who used to attend Juilliard and Curtis and had well-established careers that I’m a disappointment made me feel like no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be worthy of praise. And now that I have my degree, all I can think about is the pain associated with my years at college. That I may have improved slightly but in the long run, it doesn’t matter.",trust
2284,"The greatest example of this is my time as co-officer for a competition team with my best friend in high school. During our covid-era senior year, we didn’t think the team would survive the pandemic, but we couldn’t imagine our final year of high school without the club and decided to fight through the obstacles. While I helped with a few things throughout the year, like student outreach and public speaking ""coaching"", my friend did the bulk of all the work. She contacted the competition org for coach recs, scheduled scrimmages for us with other schools, signed our team up for the competition without school permission (which ended up being one of the most rewarding risks we’d ever taken), and so much more. She worked nearly every day to ensure we were prepared. I knew that I wasn’t nearly as stressed as my friend was, but I'm afraid she never brought it up because this was the club that made us closer. At the end of the season, we were in the top 5 at our state competition, and I’ve brought this up at every job interview since.

More recently, during my freshman year of college, I became friends with a girl in one of my classes, and we decided to start a book club together. Out of the 3 officers, I significantly did the least amount of work. I focused on the club’s social media, and that’s pretty much it. The other two were making weekly powerpoints, reserving rooms for our meetings, and deciding on the prompts we posted. While I attended the meetings, I stopped writing for the club after the first semester. I don’t think it’s fair for me to take credit for either of these achievements, even though my name is connected to both.

The couple times I’ve partaken in competitions alone this year, I didn’t receive any awards or see potential for growth. It just solidified the fact that I’m not nearly as capable as the people I surround myself with.

2286,"so hi! i (18F) am about to graduate from high school next week and in our country's curriculum, we have this so called ""honor roll"" which basically measures how well you performed in school.

ever since i started schooling, i was a consistent honor student and i took pride in my abilities, especially in academics. come 11th grade, i got a 79 (which is kind of a C+ in american grading system) for the first quarter in my statistics subject. i thought i was still able to get into the honor roll as i really studied hard in the second quarter and my final grade for the subject was an 83 (equivalent to a B). for context, one of the criteria before for being an honor student in my school was to not get a FINAL grade lower than 80, but they changed it to a QUARTERLY basis, hence i did not qualify anymore.

i still excelled in my remaining subjects for the rest of the school year in 11th grade, and even got higher grades in 12th grade. yet i still won't get that award on my graduation and it honestly sucks because even if i know i only lacked in ONE subject for ONE quarter, i feel like i am a fraud now and it has really disheartened me especially now that my graduation is near. my parents even congratulated me and told me that it isn't a bad thing but i feel like they're saying it out of pity. i just want to ask if what i'm feeling right now is impostor syndrome?

I need to meet a stakeholder next week with bad news, I know objectively it’s not all my fault it’s collective responsibility. It feels maybe I didn’t say things earlier. There is blurred lines between job roles too and I’m not sure always who has which responsibility.

The worst is letting the public down, I’ve cried before to the employee line because I felt I had ruined someone’s life.

They’ve talked to me multiple times saying I need to stop being hard on myself but when I fail and see them get upset it just shuts me down completely and makes me wants to scream “I told you I’m not cut out for this” I’m also writing this right before my shift.

The reason this kind of gives me imposter syndrome is because my last name starts with a letter that’s at the start of the alphabet.

On one hand, I don’t think that I’m the type of person who would take advantages I’ve had in life and use them to hold power over others, on the other, I can’t really know for sure how much something like this has even effected me.

Life is a long path with multiple branches all leading to the same ending. Yet each path has so many branches that it's nearly impossible to see what each path has to offer. Stick to one path, and love every moment of it because we don't know what's in store for us.

We can plan out our lives and think we know what will happen, but life has a way of throwing us curveballs. This is something that Otto Landyn Meyer, born at the cusp of the new millennium, knows all too well. His parents and grandparents had planned out his entire life for him. They knew his name years before he was conceived, and knew what his profession would be. But life had other plans.

I don't mean this in an arrogant way at all, as I like to learn and am working in an environment where I feel I still need and can learn a lot. However, I am always treated as 'the outperformer' when realistically, I have no clue why that is.  
Things to me really feel and make sense in my head and I often cannot imagine no one else considered some of the solutions/options I come up with.

Basically explain it to me once and I understand it will enough to not only understand it, but understand how certain changes in process or down-/up-stream systems might impact one another.

It feels as if it doesn't cost me effort... yet I am constantly afraid I am not doing well enough or that I should have progressed in my career at a faster pace as what I actually am.

He just started laughing and said things like ""if what you're doing is not good enough, we will all be jobless, ha-ha!"".

How is my best friend who works as a nurse, literally helping people daily, is getting a third of what I get... I sit in calls all day, make fancy PowerPoints and literally spend months on solution designs with the same senior people, having to explain things so many times.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

Due to my grades I thought it would be difficult for me to find a job, but I quickly got a position as an engineer, and two years later I am still in the same company where I have a position with a high technical profile.

After that, I searched and took Imposter Syndrome quizzes online (I know its not reliable but I just want to see how I fair) and turns out that every single one of the quizzes I took said I have a high tendency or possibility of having Imposter Syndrome.

Looking back, I think I identify with the signs of having it. I have been an achiever since I was a kid. I was a consistent Honors Student (Straight As) from Elementary to High School. In college, I did well too. I was consistent Deans List and graduated Cum Laude. I was Managing Editor of our College Newspaper and competed and won regional and national titles in Journalism competitions. 

Went to law school and did fairly well again. Took the bar only once and passed. I was a lawyer before I was 30. 

My whole life I was expected to accomplish high feats. People see me as an achiever. But to be honest, I dont see myself as such. I always think that I might be good but someone will always be better than me. I always think that I should have accomplished more rn at my age but i havent.

I feel like all the accolades and hardwork I did doesnt really make me capable. I dont like talking abt my achievements or being complimented coz I feel embarrassed. I just wanted to be lowkey. I remember passing the bar and when I was congratulated I said I was just lucky. 

I thought all these are just normal and a part of me being the introvert that I am. But when I came across the term ""Imposter Syndrome"" and read abt it felt like a glass shattered (like in HIMYM episode called ""Spoiler Alert"" lol) and it all kind of become clearer to me. I dont know who to talk to abt this so I looked for a group here on reddit hoping to get to discuss or maybe help me understand abt this more.

P.S. Im so sorry for the long ass post. I got carried away.",trust
2333,"I saw this post on Instagram the other day. It said ‘Normalize art as a career. Stop asking people what they “really do” after they tell you they are an artist’. It absolutely nailed it for me in terms of highlighting a big assumption that people make about artists: that art is just a hobby or a pastime. Of course for some it is, but for thousands of artists it is their main occupation.

2334,"Hi, 
I’ve been feeling a sense that I don’t belong at my firm anymore for quite a while. I got a small promotion and more work given to me and it feels like I’ve fumbled my way thru it all. My senior management doesn’t inform me of mistakes I’ve made anymore and instead they they just fix themselves. My manager doesn’t really speak to me anymore besides I’m teams when something is needed. And recently a team member was let go for underperforming. 

My problem is that i think I’m in the same boat as the the coworker who recently was let go. I feel as tho I underperform even tho I work late almost everyday and soon I’ll be let go too. It takes me longer to do work which in accounting is how we charge the client. If I run up a budget we lose money and I worry about it all the time. I’m trying to to study for the cpa on top of keeping whatever work life balance I can and I just honestly can’t keep up anymore.

Need some advice on how to deal with this. Minor panic attacks have started so I definitely need some sort of help.

Thanks for any advice",trust
2335,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day. I'd been wanting to apply elsewhere for a while now and now is probably a good time, but I suddenly feel so humiliated and discouraged that I don't feel like I'd be good enough anywhere.",trust

When I told my former boss about the offer I had and about a potential raise with it he said “I don’t understand why would someone pay that much for you. But I guess it’s a testament that we’re so good our competitors want our people” . 
Ever since that comment I’ve had even more imposter syndrome. I feel like I never know enough, do enough or am good enough. 
I feel like I have way too much time for my tasks so it makes me feel like I’m always not doing something.
And on top of that people have been leaving the company + layoffs in tech and feel constantly stressed, anxious and starting to feel depressed.

2339,"I frequently get imposter syndrome not about my skills but actually about my interests. 

Almost every time I'm interested on something, say sports, music, reading, I get this weird feeling that I'm faking everything, which makes me feel bad when talking to other people about those interests and also while I'm focusing on them.

It's like I think I'm supposed to know everything about something if I'm interested in it. Otherwise I'm just posing.

Just to give an example, there's this rock band I love and some years ago I showed them to my mom and more recently showed her their new album. On the other day my mother told my about this oldie song from them which I didn't know. It is an awesome song, but at that very moment I started feeling like a poser, because if I don't know that song then I don't really know anything about the band and I don't really enjoy them, I'm just faking.

This pattern has happened with almost every interest I get. I love talking to people about my interests and teach things about them, but when the opposite happens I start feeling like I'm a fraud and I'm just pretending to be more interesting than I actually am.

This is how I do it: 

1. Recognize Imposter Syndrome - recognize when the ""monster"" is speaking to you to conquer it
2. Reach out for support - you're not alone, many people go through this
3. Keep reminders of past successes - build a bank of successes you can reference to snap out of it.
4. Practice positive self-talk - refer back to your past successes to be kind to yourself 
5. Manage your thoughts - we think 60,000 thoughts every day, some of those thoughts are trash and you don't have to believe them

2362,"Quick, who is your favorite author?

One of my favorite authors right now is Michael Wickett. He's an accomplished Nightingale-Conant motivational speaker and author. His book, ***It's All Within Your Reach*** is one of the best I've ever read.

I hold him in high regard because of that book.

Most, if not all of us, feel the same way when it comes to authors. Statistically speaking, about 80 percent of the American population wants to write a book, but so few embark on this journey. If I had to guess, I would probably say that many people do not believe they have what it takes to write a book, which, at the root is simply fear. But, I once heard Les Brown say, “When your why is big enough, you will find you how.”

I’m going to lay out 10 reasons why you should write a book and maybe, just maybe after you read them, you will find you how, and if not, I promise to help you.

## Reason #1: A book is an instant confidence booster

As I mentioned at the outset, how do you normally feel about authors? Do you treat them differently from the average person? What sort of impression do you get when you're introduced to an author?

When people perceive you in a high and elevated way, you begin to feel better about yourself. It’s an instant confidence booster. Most people treat authors as celebrities. And imagine if your book hits Amazon's #1 Best-Seller Status. What would that do to your confidence and self-esteem?

I know I felt great when mine hit that status. Not in a prideful or boastful way, but just proud of myself and what I’ve accomplished since the death of my mom. I know she would be proud of me as well.

## Reason #2: A book allows you to see your value and potential

Author John Maxwell said, “Many people fail to grow and reach their potential because of low self-esteem.”

When I was depressed and contemplating suicide, my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I could not see any value or worth in my life. But I was motivated by the thought of a postage stamp and so I began to add value to my life, first by exchanging my negative thinking for more positive ones, I began to exercise, eat healthier and start back fellowshipping with my congregation.

When I began to write, I learned to get out of my head and to see my real potential and value as a human being. If you don’t realize you have genuine value or that you're worth investing in, then you’ll never put in the time or effort required to grow.

One of my favorite motivational speakers Zig Ziglar said, “It’s impossible to consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with how we see ourselves. We can positively do very few things if we feel negative about ourselves.”

I know for a fact, that every aspect of our lives is directly impacted by the way we see ourselves. When you write and pour out your heart onto paper, you see how far you’ve gotten in life, and all that you've accomplished.

## Reason #3: Writing a book is an opportunity for self-reflection

Have you ever gone to therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. Going to therapy helped me cope with being sexually molested as a young girl. Well, I get that same type of help every time I sit down to write. Writing allows you to dig deep within yourself. You are alone and vulnerable and you're able to work things out on paper that you can’t do when they stay locked up in your head.

Writing forces you to reflect on your life. Most of the time, when we take the time to self-reflect, we see patterns that we need to change and habits we need to develop.

When I was in the fifth grade, my amazing teacher, Mrs. Battle brought a snake into the classroom and we had the privilege of seeing the snake shed its skin. It was the absolute most captivating thing I’d seen at that time. When I write, I also see myself shedding my old skin, my old thinking, and my old dishonoring ways for a newer, better version of me.

Writing has allowed me to change my life and the byproduct of that is I’ve changed the way I think about myself. I no longer see myself as a victim. I am strong and unbreakable. By the way, so are you.

Our lives are so hectic. Learning to pause allows growth to catch up to you.

## Reason #4: Writing a book allows you to flex your brain power

Did you know that our brains weigh about three pounds? It is such a small organ, yet it packs a punch. When you write, even when you're writing your own story, inevitably you will have to do some research, whether that be interviewing your family members or hopping onto Google to get some facts or now, AI ChatGPT.

Our brains are muscles. Just like any muscle it needs to be flexed or it will atrophy. Writing allows you to flex your brain. When you step outside of your comfort zone you give yourself a chance to explore new things about yourself. One new point discovered can lead to other points and you never know where that can take you. I’ve learned that to be a success, you first have to think it and the only way you start to think it is, either you change or something in your life forces you to change.

Nothing in life remains the same forever.

Writing helps you to determine your future. You can write your ticket in life or continually allow someone else to force you to write theirs. Stop thinking in terms of “Can I” and start thinking in terms of “How Can I.”

“How Can I” puts a different spin on things. It’s the beginning of a high-value question that prompts you to figure it out. Start asking the right questions and your brain will begin to give you better answers.

## Reason #5: A book is an ideal way to create side-hustle income

Most people that I come into contact with would love to someday work for themselves, whether it's for financial freedom or just because they want to spend more time at home with their family.

When you write a book and you get the title of #1 best-selling author attached to you, people are going to take notice.

Published authors are considered experts and authorities in their field. If you had a book, do you think you could send that book to a business prospect? How do you think you would be perceived by that person? Would it be difficult to land that contract? I don’t think so.

Writing a book positions you as an authority. This fact can help you sell more products and services which will ultimately impact your bottom line.

Would you like to earn more money just by writing a book?

That would be a yes for me too.

Just think, what if you were allowed to get paid for sharing with other people information you already know?

Now, perhaps unlike at any other time in history, if you possess knowledge that other people would be willing to pay for, you can start making money, with little or no startup costs, especially with the help of AI.

Teaching online grants you the freedom to still work a day job yet generate side-hustle income. Today, it’s a real possibility to even make just as much money while you're asleep as when you're awake, thanks to the power of the Internet and AI.

You have the opportunity to teach and share what you're most passionate about with large audiences. Would you like to share what you love and be paid for doing so?

So now are you beginning to see how finally earning what you’re worth by sharing your knowledge and expertise with others would help boost your self-confidence and self-esteem?

## Reason #6: A book will help you get over your fears, even your fear of public speaking

Have you ever noticed that authors are usually asked to speak at conferences or seminars? Well, my friend, the same will be true for you. I know, but you’re afraid of speaking, right?

Well, the only way to face any fear is to stand up to it. We overcome our fears by doing the thing that we fear. Here are three other ways to overcome fear:

* Define your fear. When we face new situations in life, we normally imagine the worst-case scenario. But, did you know that you can dramatically shrink your fears by simply putting them into words on a piece of paper? See how writing helps you to slay fear.
* Accept the challenges that fear presents to you. Instead of shrinking back and giving fear the upper hand, accept fear as a normal part and life and act despite it. A great tool from author and speaker Mel Robbins of The 5 Second Rule, really works. Try it. When you want to do something, just count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and then do the thing that you fear. Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Do one thing every day that scares you.”
* Think of the benefits of acting in the face of your fear. Think of what it will do for your self-esteem and self-confidence. A good exercise is to physically write down the benefits you will gain by forging ahead. The thing to remember is that every decision you make is helping to form the person you are becoming. Do you want your fear to define you or do you want to take that scary risk and come off the victor?

## Reason #7: A book will help you be more productive by raising your standards

Do you find that you are easily distracted and not being as productive as you can be? Well, writing a book during a challenge will not only help you with your productivity it will also help you with developing discipline, determination and just plain grit.

When you write a book, it’s just you, the blank slate, and now AI. Writing helps you remain singularly focused on the task at hand. It is an exercise in discipline and time management. If you stick to it, your determination will give way to a beautiful masterpiece. And no, it doesn’t have to take months anymore, it can take a weekend. I will show you how to write 10 books in 30 days.

Let me ask you a question, what's the difference between something you should do and something you absolutely must do?

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, “The things easy to do are also easy not to do.” In other words, the things you should do are things that are easy not to do and so you don’t do them. Some of these things are:

I should eat healthier.

I should exercise more.

I should treat my spouse with respect.

But when you absolutely must do something, as if your life depended on it, there is a shift and change in you. If eating healthier meant you would live or die, then you most likely would do it. The same with exercise and treating your spouse with respect, if your life depended on it, you would make the necessary changes.

When you raise your standards and turn “should” into “must,” you are making an inner shift to take control over the quality of your life. Any area in which you are not getting what you want is because you haven’t raised your standards.

According to Tony Robbins, “Most people, if they look at how they are living their lives today, will find that their identity is based on a set of standards and a set of beliefs they created 10, 20, 30 or more years ago. Many of us made decisions when we were kids about what to believe, what we are capable of, and who we are as a person, and that became the glass ceiling that controls us. But are you the same person you were back then? Are you the same person you were even a year ago?”

I’m just going to say it, you have to demand excellence from yourself. Don’t be mediocre. Be world-class. Don’t settle for the status quo, be relentless. Pursue excellence. “People are rewarded in public for what they’ve practiced for years in private,” said Tony Robbins. Never ever give up. Raise your standards. Writing will help.

## Reason #8: A book will help you develop bullet-proof habits

To complete your book, you have to have good habits, otherwise, you’ll never get it done.

In 2008, after my mom died of colon and liver cancer, a few years later, I developed the habit of getting up at 4 a.m. and going to the gym. That habit has helped and sustained me all these years. I knew I had to do something to get my mind out of the loop of negativity. I knew I had to physically move my body because where my focus goes, energy flows.

With that said, I started researching other high achievers and came across Brendon Burchard. Brendon has been studying high achievers for over 20 years and the biggest secret he has learned when it comes to habits is “trigger moments.”

In essence, trigger moments are cues that remind you to activate your intentions or habits.

I use my iPhone to create my trigger moments. A lot of people underutilize this great feature on their iPhones. Right now, I want you to take your “Clock” then hit “Alarm” and then add your alarm time. Then under “Label” write out your goal – the same one you have a picture of on your board. Press “Save”. Repeat this step three times for each of your goals. So from now on, every day at that time, you’ll be reminded to accomplish your goals. This is how you attack from all sides. You have the vision board, you have the alarm and now let’s move on to tip number three.

My all-time favorite bullet-proof habit device is pen and paper. When we track what we do, things get done. As an example, I started using my Apple Watch to track how many steps I take in a day. Before I had this device, I never walked 10,000 steps, but now that I track it, I make sure I do it every day. The same is true with any habit you form. When you write it down and track it, you will see the needle move, your results will encourage you to continue going. This helps to build momentum and you will become unstoppable. Writing has a funny way of doing that.

## Reason #9: A book helps boost your self-esteem and allows you to expect more out of life

Scientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But today, they’re learning more and more that we respond to what the brain expects to happen next.

Neuropsychologists call it the expectancy theory. Basically, through a lifetime’s worth of events, our brains learn what to expect next – even if it does not happen. And because our brain expects something will happen a certain way, we often achieve exactly what we anticipate.

Do you see the dilemma?

If you don’t expect much to happen in your life, then, most likely it won’t. But if you do expect something great to occur, it most likely will. The difference is that you have to believe it will happen to you.

But how do you get that belief?

Simply put, you need to build your confidence.

**Confidence is built through action.**

A great start is simply writing down on a piece of paper, what it is that you want and expect out of life. When you put into words what you are thinking in your head, it becomes real. You now have a way to make a plan and start seeing some forward movement in your life.

In a talk at TEDx San Francisco, Mel Robbins, self-help author of the book, The 5 Second Rule, mentioned that scientists estimate the probability of your being born at about one in 400 trillion.

Do you know what that means?

It means you are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal pride. You are extraordinary. There has never been anyone exactly like you in all history of mankind on the earth. You have amazing untapped talents and abilities that, when properly directed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want or dream of.

In essence, your very existence proves you are a miracle. So start acting like the miracle you are!

In a CD by Earl Nightingale, titled, The Strangest Secret, he says, “You become what you think about.” So what are you thinking? What are you constantly feeding your mind on? Your mistakes or your accomplishments?

Your thoughts trigger images and pictures and the emotions that go with them. These images then trigger your attitudes and actions. Therefore, if you think about success, you will feel strong and competent, but when you think about your mistakes, you will inevitably feel sad and weak.

We attract into our lives that which we think about. Whatever our dominant thoughts are, that is what will show up for us in our lives. To have more self-esteem you need to think the thoughts you would be thinking if you were already achieving your goal. Writing is a great place to start.

## Reason #10: A book helps you create and leave a legacy for your friends and loved ones

When my mom died, I wished she would’ve written a book, just a story about every aspect of her life that I failed to ask about. She was an extraordinary woman that I didn’t have enough time with. I do however have a few of her songs. She was an amazing songwriter, and that’s where I get my ability to write. Thanks, mom.

When we leave this earth, a few mementos and memories are all we have left of our loved ones. What if you had more? What if you had a book that detailed the lives of your mom, dad, grandparents and more? What if you left that to your children and relatives? How would they feel? How proud would they be? Could it perhaps encourage them to confidently go after their hopes and dreams?

I believe writing a book helps create your legacy. In our digital age, there's no telling who else will be touched and inspired by your thoughts and words. At the outset, I asked who was your favorite author or writer, what if they never wrote down that very thing that inspired you?

I believe we not only owe it to ourselves to write a book, but we owe it to the universe and the generations coming behind us. Do what author Steven Pressfield suggests in his book, The War of Art. In the last pages of his book, he says that if you don’t do the thing you were meant to do, you, not only hurt yourself, you hurt the planet. He says, **“Don’t cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you got.”**",trust

2366,"The dictionary defines self-awareness as “knowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.” 

When you’re self-aware, you have an accurate and clear understanding of your character, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs and sense of self. You know what your life is about, you know how others perceive you and the effect you have on them.

Why does it matter?

Your level of self-awareness influences the key pillars in your life – your relationships, career, personal development and overall wellbeing.

· Self-awareness is necessary for taking control of your life. The direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and reactions. Self-awareness is the principal way of understanding and influencing these things. When you take control, you have choices.

· Self-awareness identifies un-resourceful beliefs and emotional reactions that stand in your way and gives you the power to make adjustments – personal growth.

· Self-awareness can lead to a greater understanding of past setbacks and challenges. We can conveniently dismiss our failures as bad luck or a lack of proper timing. But it’s also possible that we failed to perceive the situation, others, or ourselves accurately. It’s much easier to see the reason behind relationship, work, and other struggles when we can look at ourselves honestly.

· Self-awareness is critical for successful leadership. Leaders with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses are able to build teams that compensate those weaknesses and leverage the strengths.

· Self-awareness is the foundation for personal growth. Without it, any personal development efforts will be severely hampered – as if you’re building on sand.  
   
 

# How Can I Develop Self-Awareness?

· **Develop the habit of Noticing your thoughts.** Our minds are constantly churning through ideas and endlessly providing commentary. Becoming aware of these thoughts, and noticing the common themes gives the potential for encouraging more resourceful self-talk.

○ Notice your thinking patterns. What are you thinking when you’re feeling nervous? Bored? Interested? Walking down the street? – what does this mean for you?

○ Do you judge people and situations? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future? Do you expect the worst to happen or the best? Or do you adopt an open attitude of, “Let’s just see what happens”?

· **Notice your feelings.** What are you feeling throughout the day? What do you feel while you’re eating? Driving to work? Lying in bed? Waiting in line?

○ As you notice each emotion, question it. What am I feeling? Why? What do I need right now? How do I normally react in this situation? Is this resourceful for me? 

· **Reflect on how you deal with frustration or emotional discomfort.** ***A huge chunk of your time is spent trying to make yourself feel better.*** If you feel slightly frustrated or uncomfortable, then you may spend a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to change the situation or the others around you to resolve those negative feelings. Would id be more resourceful to develop your responses – which you can control – or try to change others – who you do not control. 

○ Do you try to control others? Do you attempt to distract yourself? Is your first instinct to leave the situation? Do you surf the internet or eat a big bowl of ice cream?

· **Consider your friendships.** Where do you meet new friends? Are most of your friendships long-term or short? When your friendships end, what is the common cause? What types of people do you prefer to be friends with? What types of people do you avoid?

· **Consider your intimate relationships.** Do you see patterns in the type of people that you’ve been involved with? What are the common positive and negative characteristics they share? Why do you think those people appealed to you?

○ What were your shortcomings in your relationships? Are you clingy? Jealous? Too focused on work? Fail to communicate your needs? Think about how you contributed to the successes and failure of your relationships.

○ Have you changed your approach from relationship to relationship, or do you continue to repeat the same patterns?

· **Keep a journal.** This is a highly effective way to learn about yourself by recording your thoughts, feelings, and experiences each day. Be sure to include your high and low points for the day.

○ Note how well you ate and slept, too. Sleep – especially changes in sleeping patterns - can elicit very valuable information about what is going on. 

○ Create a habit of writing in your journal for at least 15 minutes each day. You’ll start to notice patterns and learn a lot about yourself.

· **Reflect on your core values.** Think about and then document your core values, goals and intentions. You might be surprised by what you write. This is a great first step for understanding yourself and your beliefs.

· **Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses.** How do you know? Are you certain? Avoid jumping to conclusions. You may have always believed that you’re a hard worker, but are you? To whom are you comparing yourself? Provide yourself with proof before you make any decisions. Are you noticing any limiting beliefs – I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy?

· **What would others say about you?** Consider how your partner, children, friends, family, co-workers, and boss would describe you. What would they suggest you improve about yourself? How do you respond to thinking about what others think about you?

· **Trance.** Meditation is all about developing a better awareness of the present moment and yourself. *Meditation is an ideal activity for enhancing self-awareness. Hypnosis / Self-hypnosis is all about using the trance state to support your general wellbeing and specific outcomes.*

○ Meditate at least once each day. Spend the rest of the day paying attention to yourself, others, and your surroundings. You can develop a higher degree of self-awareness by just paying attention.

○ Question yourself throughout the day.  *“What emotions am I currently feeling and why?” “What are the people around me feeling?” ‘’what is the best use of my time right now?’’*",trust

2373,"I have a Masters in computer science from a relatively prestigious school, and I’ve received praise and awards from respected tech companies.

But… all I hear are the words of three people:


My Dad - When I got into a top program for a Ph.D in Computer Science he was only disappointed I didn’t get into MIT.  

When I placed at the top of my college class and won a faculty award for my senior project, he later criticized it saying his idea would have been better and that it didn’t go anywhere (it did, later years based their work on mine).



My Professor - I wrote a thesis for an honors program, and he was supposed to read and give feedback.  My primary professor loved it and praised me.

This other professor said he wasn’t convinced, said the entire field (unconventional computing) is a waste, and it doesn’t make sense to get a Ph.D unless you’re someone “like Hawking or Einstein”.  He himself was a Harvard grad, and his words really took a toll on me.



My Best Friend - Just regularly puts me down.. calls me ugly, never celebrates my accomplishments and criticizes me instead.  I always do my best to give him support and rarely criticize his work (the rest of the world does that enough).  

But, it feels like he needs to make me feel inferior.  One time I met some new friends, both with a “prestigious”  C.S. background, and we started a project together.  My friend immediately snapped and said “well they’re obviously smarter than you”.



I just have this constant stream of echos in my head, mostly from these three people, and it kills my confidence.

2375,"I’ve always had issues with imposter syndrome but it’s never been this bad and I don’t know what to do anymore. I am in my last 3 months of graduate school where I am set to complete a dual masters degree with a dual concentration. My GPA is a 3.8, so on paper it sounds like I’m extremely intelligent in my field, but in reality I don’t even know what the day to day work life would look like for someone in my career path. I’m currently completing my Capstone for my degree and I’m struggling horribly with writing just the proposal. I have no idea how to write a sound study design and can’t wrap my head around writing all most 10 pages worth of information on a project that is still far into the future (in terms of data sources, limitations I might have, data analysis). 

When I was in the thick of my graduate curriculum I always received good grades and got things done on time, but I think I just learned how to do homework really well. For example, I was taking my degree at an accelerated rate in order to graduate sooner, so I was completing more classes than was recommended or than what my peers were. Because of this, a lot of the assigned reading/work for each class was doubled so I physically wouldn’t be able to complete all of it exactly as I should’ve, in a timely manner, while also trying to live a life and working full time. My work around was that I would skim a lot of it, and never do any of the optional or supplemental work. I would give the bare minimum of effort on assignments, in order to get an A or high B. And it worked, like I said I completed my curriculum with a high 3.8 GPA. But now… I think I really regret not reading everything word for word. I feel like I can’t even tell you what I learned. 

Now that I am almost done with my degree, which hopefully even freaking happens at this point… I have to start finding a job. I’ve been applying to 10-20 jobs almost everyday and I can’t even get someone to give me an in person interview for an entry level position in my field, and I now have THREE advanced degrees. More so, I sometimes try to imagine some of the field related questions they may ask me when I finally do land one, and I LITERALLY can’t imagine I would know ANY of the answers to anything they may ask. Not to mention, from reading the basic job descriptions I have almost no qualifications…so like why did I even put myself in this much debt for these degrees that apparently mean nothing now?

At this point, I feel like I’ll never succeed in this field, I have dread every day that I’ll horribly embarrass myself in interviews or talks with other similar professionals, and now I don’t even know if this field was for me to begin with. 

Please tell me other people have experienced this!",trust
2376,"Sometimes it feels like my actions are geared, all of the time, to prove my imposter syndrome right. I applied for a job, genuinely believing I wouldn't receive an invitation to interview. I couldn't sleep the night I applied because I was humiliated at the thought of someone reading my C.V. To my surprise I got a call to interview. Shortly after that call, I told myself that they had already chosen another candidate for the job, and my invitation for interview was only because they had to fulfil a certain quota of interviewees. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well after that either.

Anyway, I performed poorly in my interview today and I didn't get the job. What do you know, my imposter syndrome was right all along. Running narratives like: it was silly of me to apply in the first place, why did I think I would've gotten this anyway, of course they had someone else in mind, I'm not skilled at interviewing so why would I even bother. I remember beforehand sitting in the interview waiting room thinking it's not too late for me to run away, cancel the interview, save the shame. 

What is this (imposter syndrome) about? Is it a perverse sense of self-preservation? Never fully committing to believing in myself, because the fall from grace would be too great? Feeling like I have to run harmful stories about myself, so that I can 'get in' before any threat enters? It doesn't work though. I still feel a bit upset despite 'expecting failure' - maybe because I realise that the way I treat myself is unfair, and ultimately doesn't get me anywhere.

Still, things I'm proud of (because fuck you imposter syndrome):

* I proved I can get to interview stage, gap in C.V. be damned 
* I can get through an interview, maybe not \*successfully\*. But the world didn't end. I'm alive. I'm here. The embarrassment of trying (& trying & failing & trying) won't kill me.
* I have accomplishments that speak for themselves and experiences to back it up. This is actually the objective truth and imposter syndrome can't take that away.
* I'm still breathing. And I'll try again and continue on with as open a mind as I can muster.",sadness

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",trust

2390,"**Invest in yourself, and your self-image will flourish:**

**Identify and challenge your limiting beliefs.** While they have many guises, most limiting beliefs can be distilled down to two essential beliefs: I’m not good enough & I’m not worthy. We may also carry over beliefs from our early years which served us well then but now hinder us as adults.

**Recognize – and celebrate - your small victories.** Whatever small victories are meaningful to you. Within the context of having strategic plans, each small step is a victory in itself and also a step towards something so much bigger.

**Take responsibility for your current situation.** When you take responsibility, you take control. And when are in control, you have options and choices.

**Do something for others.** Creating meaning for yourself and value for others helps build your win / win relationship with the world around you.

**Take a step each day toward your ideal self.** We all have the same 168 hours each week – that’s just physics – the issue is what we choose to do with them. Adopting the habit of frequently asking yourself: what would be the most valuable thing I can do right now that would be a step in the right direction?

**Manage your self-talk.** We all talk to ourselves – it’s just how our brains work. When we choose to take control of our internal dialogue, we can make it work for us.

**Focus on the value adding activities.** When we think about what we have on our plate, considering how important and how urgent each item is really puts things in perspective. When we focus our efforts on what is important – in the context of what we have chosen to achieve – we’re moving in the right direction.

**Avoid comparing yourself to others.** This points to the difference between self-esteem (externally focused) and self-worth (internally focused). The only valid comparison is our previous self.

**A healthy self-image is central to our wellbeing. By adopting these habits, we can help ourselves to keep moving in the right direction.**",trust

For anyone working in assurance, you would know its standard practice to “promote” associates to audit seniors after 4-5 years, depending on personal performance. This just happened to me. As many in assurance would also know, deadlines are often strict and require frequent overtime. In the 3 going on 4 years I’ve worked, I’ve always felt I’m falling behind my peers in being able to meet deadlines. However, I prided myself in being competent in the work I do, finding and resolving issues in clients’ financials that other peers wouldn’t necessarily do. 

The issue is that I think greater importance is being placed on being able to meet deadlines with the bare minimum quality of work by management in order to charge more fees to more clients who wouldn’t notice a drop in audit quality. Suddenly, after a few months of being an audit senior I feel like I do not deserve my position. Management is constantly on my case about cutting down on time and cost on audits, even though I raised concerns about cutting corners. 

Even though I feel I do my absolute best, I still do not satisfy the higher-ups. The peace of mind I always gave myself of doing high quality work doesn’t bring me the confidence in my competence it once did. I feel I’m not deserving of the position management gave me given the difference in where myself and management place our impotance on quality vs quantity.

Are any of you in similar situations where you think your and management’s midsets are different to the point of causing feelings of inadequacy? How do you cope?

Ps: I’m not considering quitting and/or changing carriers just yet. This job is a stepping stone for where I want to be eventually, and the sunken cost is forcing me to just finish getting my accreditation. I just want to be able to not feel the way I currently do for the coming 2 to 4 years.

At the time I attributed my lack of confidence to my natural ""pass first"" play style, but now I realize that there was probably some imposter syndrome going on. (If you're familiar with the NBA, I often felt like Ben Simmons in the Hawks playoff series)

I've also noticed that this imposter feeling has manifested itself in my social life. Whenever I girl gives me explicit indication that they are interested in sexually/romantically, I panic. I find that I often try to convince myself that a person that is attracted to me has created a fictional version of myself that does not exist.

3. I’m experiencing discomfort when there is a short and easy way to cut the path in my job, and very much stick to the formal and formality sometimes it seems replacing the real result achievement by routine non-effective actions.
4. When having planned for something and it fails or time changes it feels like if the whole day is lost and performance drops drastically
5. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) Father never actually hugged me in my life so that I remember it
6. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) I also never seen my father kissing my mother in my life
7. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) My father was using high voice on me often and calling me names when I was wrong or if I have lost something, I was afraid of him coming home for some time
8. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) My mother was making me to practice the music instrument and I like music genuinely but I had to study all the time, had not much of social communication experience outside of a school
9. I have no friends, I had some from school, but those were lost with time
10. When I do my job I tend to overcomplicate
11. I can’t do the art that I like cause I seem to force myself to be and act as someone else and even if the idea was good in the beginning it spoils quickly as soon as mind takes control over inspiration
12. I can tell looking at photos of me 10 years ago that I perceive myself being more ugly than my appearance really was at that time.
13. I was achieving things in life and sports but when I look back I see like if I wasn’t seeing this as real at the time I had those achievements, like if I tend to better value and see the value in these after long time passed, but never at the exact moment
14. I do job that I don’t like, but I succeed with earning money for a middle class kind of life being an immigrant, I work in engineering
15. It seemed to me I was never being able to focus on something for real, and like my reading was for the sake of the action not the actual information in the book. F.ex.

2399,"Hi everyone,

I (fairly) recently got promoted at work, and I’ve been really struggling with what I’m assuming is imposter’s syndrome ever since. :( I’m finding it really really hard. 

My job is research based, originally I was doing more admin tasks and I was quite happy and confident in what I was doing. After my promotion I became more directly involved with conducting the research itself. It’s a big change in my role and the day-to-day activities in my job.

When I went for the promotion, I kind of worried this would happen. I’m a people pleaser, I suffer with social anxiety and OCD, so I did think that this might be too much for me, but there was pressure to go for it from colleagues, friends, family etc. I thought getting promoted would look good to others and therefore make me feel better about myself :( 

However now I’m stuck in the job and I’m just really struggling. We have deadlines, so I feel like I’m constantly rushing to finish things. When I rush, I get stressed because the quality of my work isn’t as good as I feel it should be. I worry there are mistakes that I don’t have time to rectify, then I worry that the mistakes mean I’m not good enough to be in this role. I’m also slower because I meticulously check everything for errors, which I worry doesn’t look good for my performance, further proving to myself that I don’t deserve this job. Generally I’m worried my lack of knowledge is going to be revealed somehow, that there will be some huge problem with my work that I won’t spot because I’m not intelligent enough etc. I then worry I’ll get fired from my job. 

I think this is all kind of linked to the OCD. The perfectionism, the meticulous checking like I just can’t let go. I’ve always struggled with these things, but the imposter’s syndrome has never been as bad as this. I dread getting up and going to work now, whereas I never used to mind it. 

I’ve spoken to my boss about the struggles a little, but I’m so ashamed of myself and don’t want to admit how hard I’m finding it. 

Does anyone relate to this? Any tips on making it more bearable? I’m feeling really useless at the moment :(

To elaborate on my situation. I dream to be an A-List Hollywood Producer. Currently, I haven’t even begun the process but I literally have exactly what I need to do mapped out to a T and how to get there. 

I’ve done research and am aware of steps A-Z on how to get it done. I have the confidence and belief in myself that I WILL accomplish it. But…

The problem is every time I even THINK about taking step #1, I get hit with an immediate cloud of Imposter Syndrome. But it doesn’t make any sense for me to feel that way because I’ve accomplished literally nothing yet. 

What goes through my mind are thoughts like:

“wait who are YOU to do something like this?” 

“You don’t deserve the success that’ll come when you do it.” 

“You won’t even be successful if you try”

“Even if you do produce a great film who are you to have the success that’ll come with it?”

“You were nothing working a normal job before, so why suddenly get the success now? You don’t deserve it.”

I’m fully aware that a lot of it is resistance preventing me to start, but I hate the fact that I feel like I’m thinking so far ahead without even beginning. So it becomes this weird hurdle of “fake” or “pre” Imposter Syndrome which leads to 2 years of resistance to start.

2417,"When I was a kid the only thing my mother saw in me was my ""potential"". Despite me not doing well in school she was convinced that I was a genius in the making. She thought school was a waste of time and gave me her blessing to play hooky whenever I felt like it, because for some reason she thought I was a natural genius that ""didn't need to study"". For some reason, despite this, she would still fly into a rage at me whenever my teacher would call to complain that I wasn't doing well in school (idk how or why she could hold these two opposing attitudes at the same time and yet she did). So basically at any given time she was either love bombing me because of my imaginary brilliance, raging at me because of my failures, or neglecting me. So nowadays I have crippling imposter syndrome that makes me see failure in everything I do and ever have done and anticipate it in anything I ever plan on doing - which, in turn, causes me to self sabotage like crazy, and even though I'm aware of it idk how to stop.

2418,"As an aspiring author, (haven't completed or published anything) I have a ton of different ideas that I plan to write out as novels. I have roughly 10+ that I could take the basic concept of and run with.

That being said, on my (hopeful) debut novel, I have 20,000+ words already out of a goal of 75,000+. I've asked several people in my bubble to read over sections of what I have written. Very few of them have read any of it, let alone given me any feedback on on it. The need for validation had me asking periodically if they'd read anything. I've since given up due to lack of feedback or anyone actually reading.

I have it in my head that if they (friends/family) don't want to read it, it must not be worth reading. So why should I bother trying? I'm mentally stuck wondering if it's because ""I'm only tolerated and not genuinely liked as a person"", or ""This is trash, they don't want to read it"", or ""They're too busy with their lives to even think about it"".

I shared this info elsewhere but basically, I constantly downplay my own skills and capabilities. Always reminding myself that there is someone out there who basically surpasses me in everything I can/will do. (And yes, it does bring me down due to the accuracy of that statement.) That's not the main reason for this post.

Unlike most cases where it's usually job/hobby related. Mine is related to personality. I don't know why, I'm pretty sure I do not possess any kind of personality disorder. And I have been told repeatedly time after time again that I am a good person, but for some odd reason, my brain doesn't believe this and attempts to coerce me into believing that I am in an A-hole. Brewing the idea that I may as well expose myself as the a-hole In r/amitheasshole or r/Niceguys respectively.

No I have not done anything (to my knowledge), note worthy for a post there and yes, it's something that I constantly worry about. I'm worried that I'm secretly a disgusting incel, which is why I don't approach woman for any kind of flirting/relationship. Let alone converses with them.

I'm worried that I'm gonna upset an employee at retail because I need help with something even though that poor soul probably had to deal with borderline psychotic customers on a daily basis, if Reddit is to go by. So, I never ask.

2421,"Hello I am new here M (24). I have been a poor student ever since I can remember. I failed 5 grade (who fails 5th grade ffs?). I am not a poor learner or stupid by any means but I was never able to get even average grades. A lot of which had to do with the nature of my dad’s job. We moved around a lot, including abroad where I lacked proper schooling.

11 and 12 grade are super important in our country because they decide the university you will get in. I was so badly prepared for 11 that I decided to repeat. And when I repeated I failed. I had zero hope of getting anywhere.

But still I applied to every university possible. I knew that would only get into shitty ones. But by an absolute stroke of luck I got into a very good university (top 5 or something). I had an excellent entrance test score somehow and I forgot my result card so they just assumed I passed 11th grade (which I later did but not at the time). Very lucky.

University life was super tough for me. I had to study twice as hard as other to get half the results others were getting. I was so very close to failing multiple courses every semester but somehow I always managed to pass by slimiest of margins. My GPA was only 2.58/4 (that too thanks to COVID) but I graduated in 4 years. Very lucky again.

I started applying for jobs before my last semester even began. I was starting to see how my low GPA was holding me back. Everyone who started applying after me got the jobs they wanted. I was left behind. Felt extremely bad but I kept looking. 

My cousin referred me to a Big 4 firm. They don’t hire from our university, they only hire CPA or ACCA and i was just a Bsc student. The hiring process is also very tough. Tests and interviews. I gave my best and somehow I cleared it all. Turns out they were very short staffed so they made an exception for me. Very lucky again.

Its been 3 months and the job is going fine. But I do feel dumb compared to others as their knowledge is way more then me. I still do my best, I always pretend that I know shit when in reality I don’t. I constantly live in this fear that one day I will be exposed and it will all come crumbling down. They will know I just got into university by luck, i got into the firm by luck. In reality I don’t have the credentials for this job. I failed 5th grade, I failed 11th twice, i hardly passed university.

On the other hand many people who know me believe that i got into university and the firm because my father is somewhat influential. That is absolutely not the case. He dint even know I applied to these place till I got in.

It hurts a lot living with this fear everyday.  I hate this and sometimes want to get out and quit. I have no idea how to over come this fear. I dont know what to do.",anticipation

2428,"This is my first time posting here.
I, 34M, am highly doubting my work competences.
I’ve been reading about imposter and think this is what I have.

Let me give background. I come from a family of High intellectual potentials. Although never tested, both my sisters are diagnosed.
I am very sensitive to the opinion of others.

In school, I always succeeded with little effort. I never hid that I did not work and got many jealousy as a result. So I hid my grades.
In university, I got great grades while my gf, now wife, had a harder time, although we studied the same. (She made the schedule).

I’m quite sure I wouldn’t have gotten my degree without her planning.

After my master, I did a PhD, got praise from the jury. But if you ask me, I’ll tell you my research wasn’t worth it, it contributed 0 to science and only got published because my supervisor was good at writing.

I did a Postdoc but then completely changed field.
I felt inadequate in that job, that I wasn’t properly qualified for it.
During my postdoc, I passed a teacher certification, which was easy. 
I couldn’t continue the classes, so I ended up going straight for the jury and received the certification, thanks to my good memories from the previous year lesson.

I did not start working as a teacher, I did something completely different still.
I’ve been doing that job for 3 years. I started mid 2019 and we soon had Covid. I have been unable to resume “as before”. I feel like nothing I do makes a difference so I avoid doing. I’m failing this job and my boss will soon figure it out. Although so far no one said I was doing an inappropriate job.

I then requested to change position in August. And am transitioning positions currently.

Todays, had a progress meeting and was only told I need to make sure I plan and prioritize better. I know this is a weakness I have. I’m too « hot », in the moment.

I procrastinate until last minute and then rush to finish. Mostly because tasks seem impossible. And am not happy because the result is not exactly as I imagined it.

Now I’m lost.
Is it imposter, am I just incompetent, am I really not organized enough, am I just too perfectionist?
I feel like I’m exaggerating thinking it’s imposter.

I’m thinking of seeking help, but first, how do you tell your wife you feel like a failure undeserving of your position?

For context, I’m 26, from the UK. A few years ago I completed an undergraduate degree in Physics, then recently my PhD. For the last 10 months I’ve been working as a Data Analyst - I passed my probation with no problems and I’m doing well at it.

Despite all of this, I still convince myself every day that I know barely anything; that everyone else is so much better than me, and that I’m just no good. I’m also scared to apply for higher paying roles because I’m worried I’ve found my limit, and that if I got another role I’d fail my probation or something.

I also have concerns about my memory. I’ve learnt so much stuff over the years and now I just feel like I’m forgetting so much, and just that I’m so much more forgetful and distant than previously. I sometimes struggle to pay attention in simple conversations with family and friends because my mind is elsewhere trying to see if I can remember (almost testing myself) stuff to prove I’ve not forgotten something. Maybe it’s just part of getting older, I don’t know…

I know this is probably all just imposter syndrome because nobody has ever raised any concerns about my ability or conduct. And, that the reason I’m probably forgetting more things is because I’m still learning other new things.

I'm always trying to remind my coworkers to be mindful when they say mean things and I feel like a hypocrite when I do because who am I to correct them even though I make a conscious effort to be mindful.

I can't keep my hands off of him which worries me more that he'll think it's lust when I just love him a lot and I feel a transfer of that energy when I touch him. 

It is the most confusing thing to be so sure about my connection with someone and the solidity of the relationship but to also second guess it knowing that there is no reason to. Having had a toxic relationship in the past where my tunnel vision was so strong that I glorified every flaw and let him warp my being, it's difficult not to worry I'm doing the same thing sometimes but I know I'm not but back then I would've thought the same so how can I ever know.

Naturally, during PhD impostor syndrome was there at all times. Main ""reasoning"" why I'm going to be fired were common ADHD symptoms: forgetting, chaos, lack of planning skills etc. I covered it all by working much more than my peers, hence I felt I don't belong since others didn't have to work that hard to be there.

2450,"TL;DR: I landed an internship at the highest ranked law firm in my country bc I’m skilled at taking exams, not because I’m super smart. Also, my writing skills aren’t great. I feel like such an impostor and like I’m going to fail before everyone’s eyes/get a bad internship-report/grade after my internship ends. Any advice? - Not necessarily looking for life changing solutions (although welcome!), but any advice/tips/words of encouragement or other opinions are appreciated :) 

*edit: the ‘highest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it’s one of the reasons why I don’t belong there

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I’ve been more insecure than ever lately & I’m having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‘ranked’ #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don’t always say everything - but let’s just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it’s because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‘honors/cum laude’ grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I’m not trying to say I’m absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I’m not actually super talented, I’m just good at ‘taking exams’ + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I’m neurodivergent and am quite ‘slow’ in understanding things (even if it’s something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren’t so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‘grade’ I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I’m a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

I want to caveat this post by saying I know how lucky I am and that I have realised suffering is relative and money does not mean happiness. Not by a long shot. 

On paper life is great. Earlier this year I came up with an idea with some friends and we build this company which we promptly sold (finalising last week). At the same time, ive met a woman of my dreams. Loving, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.   


Last week, I got paid for selling the company. I now have more money than I know what to do with and the love of a beautiful woman. Everything should be great right?   


When I got paid out last Friday I started having panic attacks and questioning my happiness. Not so much if I deserve it but coming to terms that, somehow, for reasons I cant really put my finger on I am not happy. I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in my life at a fairly early age but it has caused me to realise that I didnt even know what I truly wanted.   


I started withdrawing into myself in regards to my relationship almost immediately. Questioning my feelings and thoughts for this person who is changing my life for the better on a daily basis.   


I asked her for some space to try and figure this out and it backfired. Badly. To the point where she is saying I need to figure things out before I can ""have others in my life"".   


I now dont know what to make of it all. I am coming to terms with my new life but after working so hard for so long and going nowhere and being alone for so long only to have achieved all this ""success"" in both my personal and professional life so quickly has left me confused, anxious and extremely emotional.   


I think perhaps I dont feel worthy of it all. That I have gotten lucky but I am not sure what is the whole answer.",anticipation

But.........I feel like a rookie. There are some many new processes and systems to understand and these things take time which isn't always easy to find when you are doing daily fire fighting dealing with sickness, safeguardings, shift cover, being a smiling friendly face of the home with a need to promote it as a business etc etc. Yesterday I was filled with anxiety, today has been better but the lurking fear is there that I will be found out as not able to do the job

I also need to watch what I'm saying to people as my usual line at the minute is, well I'm new and still learning so I don't know all the answers etc etc but I'll try my best

There's so much to learn and I'm committed to that and determined, I can usually harness the anxiety as that's just normal part of growth and new situations but I'm off the back of a bad work experience about a year ago when I got bullied out of somewhere when people played on weaknesses and I didn't think I was supported well or had a good induction

2466,"I’m kinda realizing a glaring issue I have that tremendously hinders my time management and my school/life balance in general  

I’m a graphic design major. The first step in every project (or, like, project extension) is research. We research subject matter, connecting themes and concepts, color pallets, design styles, font choices and parings, design techniques etc. It’s an important part of our process, and then comes sketches and executing our chosen concept. (This all will be relevant in a min)

I’m in a super competitive design program. Two portfolio review processes not before, but after semesters of design classes. Only 40 of the 400 end up making it. 
It was hell, but it’s my senior year and I’m almost finished. I used to really like graphic design, I was passionate about it. I worked my ass off to make it through the portfolio reviews.  I think I placed my whole identity and self worth in my ‘dream career’. I had so many anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns during the portfolio review portion of this degree (the first 2 years). Now I don’t have to worry about passing the review, but I think i was mentally in fight or flight mode for so long that my brain is still recovering and something isn’t quite right. 

Despite making it through both reviews, My confidence is shattered. I second guess every decision I make. Everyone around me is so talented and I feel like a fraud. I’ve worked really hard to get here, but I’m so burnt out I can barley function. I have pretty strong negative associations with school, class, my work, and myself. 


Every single night, we have assignments and things we need to present in the next class. And every single night, the same cycle repeats.

I research, research, research. I spend hours stuck gathering inspiration, jotting down concepts, all because I’m afraid of moving onto the next step. I don’t eat meals, I don’t spend time with friends, and I’m not even doing any of the ‘real’ work until my internal clock kicks in maybe around 3 AM or in the morning before class. It’s always rushed together and I’m never proud of it. Because I’m never proud of my work, doing homework the next day becomes even harder. My brain does NOT want to move past the research step. Ever. I never feel ready. I loop myself into a constant cycle of spending WAY to much time on a meaningless first step, neglecting the important work, and feeling shitty about myself. I’ll be on my laptop after hours of throwing together pages and pages of mood boards I will hardly use, still doing the same thing and mentally screaming at myself to stop and I can’t. I never do, until the very last minute where I’ll have no other choice to.
I am self aware that this isn’t helping me, and yet every time in the moment I’ll still subconsciously justify it by convincing myself ‘at least I’m being productive rn, I’ll move on to the next step soon."" (It’s never soon) Im so upset at myself because I know if I could actually manage my time I’d have have the time to get everything done that I need to and still enjoy things like spending time with people, making meals, getting enough sleep, etc. I have the time to make quality work, too. It’s like I don’t let myself do any of that. 

I’ve pulled 5 all-nighters in the first 4 weeks. I’ve already missed 3 classes and been 30 min late to 2. Again, I don’t hang out with friends, I hardly ever eat full meals, i don’t go to parties or bars or play video games or any of that. It feels like this is all I do and my work is never good and I’m just making myself miserable. I’m so upset at myself and I deeply regret the hours and hours I waste on a daily basis.

My entire college experience has been like this, except at some point I was actually motivated by a love for graphic design. At this point I just want it to be over. I’m so tired, I feel defeated. There’s no way this is even a viable career option for me if I can’t even balance my projects in college. 


Sorry if this seemed really dramatic, I didn’t sleep last night.

2467,"For some context, I was super driven after graduating college(around 7 years ago) to land something at one of the FAANGs, I mean who isn't right? After a point I’d just do it for laughs, but last time I did(not a FAANG but pretty up there! about 4 months ago), I landed an interview. My reaction? I was laughing, OUT LOUD and kinda ready to fall flat on my face during this process (Thought it would be one hell of an experience). It was supposed to be a very thorough process with 5, FIVE different rounds! as I was told. Well I did the first one ready to be rejected right away(even though I was prepping hard). To my surprise, I received an email with the schedule for the next one a couple days later while I was still working. if you’re curious about what my response was - I took sometime to read the email over and over again just to make sure this was not just a hallucination, walked straight from my home office to my bedroom and did my happy dance LOL

In summary, I wasn’t hoping to get in at all since I didn’t apply with the intention/drive to making it. Given that they absolutely destroyed me in the last one, I was now ready for a very generic rejection email. But hear me out - I GOT IN PEOPLE! I GOT IN FOR REAL THIS TIME AND ENDED UP WITH MAJOR IMPOSTER SYNDROME. I’ve been here for about 3 months now and everyone on my team is so, SO good at what they do and I’m afraid to look stupid everyday. It is so hard to believe that I made it. I keep telling myself that its okay to not be the smartest in the room but it’s super hard to focus and be so scared at the same time.

2469,"It occurred to me earlier today that this is an opportunity to prove to myself that I’m not an imposter and I can and should be doing this job, but the truth is I don’t believe that and I can’t stop freaking out about it. 

I always get nervous about presentations and talks but this is a whole other level. I’ve been feeling sick and dizzy since I agreed to it (why oh why did I agree to it - oh yeah, because if I didn’t I’d feel like an even bigger imposter), I’ve had a tension headache for a few days now, last night I woke up the pain was so bad, and it’s like my whole body is just really tense all the time and I have this constant sense of dread that I cannot shake.

Maybe I have anxiety. If I don’t feel better after the presentation I’ll go to the GP.

I think what’s making it worse is it’s with my boss (or in front of him) and I already feel like he made a mistake hiring me and I’m not the person he thought I was. I wasn’t going to apply because I thought it was too much of a step up for me, but my recruiter talked me into it, and by some miracle I did well in the interview. Normally I’m bad at interviews but know I can do the job. This time it was like I became one of those people who interviews well but doesn’t really have what it takes to deliver.

It’s also probably the most objectively important presentation I’ve ever had to do.

I’ve never messed up a presentation before, in fact people have even complimented me on them in the past (I think they’re pleasantly surprised because I make no secret of how much I hate doing them - to colleagues, not the people I’m presenting to), but I can’t help thinking this is the one I’m going to mess up. It doesn’t help that my many practice runs still aren’t great and don’t seem to be getting better. It especially doesn’t help that I’m going to be presenting on Teams, which I’ve never done before, and our whole IT system is changing tomorrow. 

The sad thing is, even if I have another miracle and it goes well tomorrow, I know that won’t be enough for me to believe I’m not an imposter and I can and should do this job. I’ll just pass it off as a fluke or dismiss it as inconsequential. There’s always another way I could fail - another way I have to prove myself.

And so when this psychologist, by all accounts a good one, tried to help me out of all this negative self-talk, all I could think was ""OK, so they don't see what's ACTUALLY going on with me. The fix they are trying to push applies to people who aren't actually imposters. But I am. So this fix doesn't apply to me and won't work.""

When in actuality, I put a total of 5 hours of effort, the day before it’s due. Getting this kind of feedback day in and out and then seeing people who ACTUALLY put in the effort getting 60’s and 50’s is crushing my mind with guilt and anxiety.

For example, on a essay I had to write about a social topic of concern, I choose food scarcity. So did 5 other people. Now, I obviously left it to the last minute, threw some things together and BAM, essay done. Everyone else, took the entire 2 months allotted to this assignment that’s worth 40% of our overall grade to do it.

I feel stupid even though I'm predicted mostly As and A*s. Just typing that statement makes me feel stupid, as I think that my good grades should prove to me that im not stupid, so I shouldn't be suffering from imposter syndrome.
Also, I study by doing past papers, so I have to mark them myself. However, there are two problems with this. I usually have to stop marking half way through the paper because I'm too scared of what the end score will be that I feel like I can't keep marking to find out. I know that I might get a good score but I'm too scared of getting a bad score so I can't keep marking it.
Another problem is that if an answer is incorrect, sometimes I have to mark it correct just to keep a good score, even though getting that question wrong doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to get a bad score overall. This makes me feel bad because I'm lying, yet I can't seem to stop doing these things.

So naturally life happend, I got into engineering school, went to grad school abroad, finished my thesis, got offered a job before graduation, and have successfully managed to get more offers  and so far so good I guess. But for the last 13 years of my life since high school I've been feeling like I have scammed my way through here. Like I have only made it this far because I'm cunning but not really smart enough. Today I had a job interview at my dream company. I didn't do well, part of it. It was the 3rd round. All the people in my life are telling me that they wouldn't let me interview this far if I wasn't good enough. But I feel like I bombed and people will finally see me for the fraud and dumb person I am. Idk, I have such terrible self esteem and despite all evidence pointing to contrary I feel like I an absolutely dumb person and have made it so far on pure luck and the ability to talk my way through things. I am tired of not reaching my full potential and feeling this way. Is this imposter syndrome? Now what do I do?",trust
2486,I have noticed that if I challenge myself or get challenged I have a propensity to instantly give up and believe that there is someone far superior then me that can get all of this done better then I can and this feeling cloud my thinking. Recently I was given an IQ test and I was so scared that I'm not smart as I appear to be and that if there was someone else in my place he would probably get this done asap. Initially I didn't score much but then when I calm up a bit and started to think I managed to solve it. I feel like no matter what I do around 50-70% of my mind is working on regulating this feeling while the rest is just working on the actual problem. When I read about imposter syndrome I felt like that's me but I doubt I have evidence that suggests otherwise and I wonder if I have been living in dunning Kruger all my life.,fear

I am a team lead and so much is changing... My manager asked me this week how I'm doing, if I felt challenged enough, if I was happy. Why do I panic? I immediately thought I'd be fired.

I get really bad intrusive thoughts and dwell in them. I had a horrible sleep all week because I cannot stop thinking about work, how I should have an exit plan. 
I fear my boss will make my role redundant because of the changes are happening. I keep thinking he does not need me in this team lead capacity and my salary is too high to go back to my old role.

My rational brain is trying to tell me that my boss never had a bad comment on my work, he's only being encouraging and supportive. He asks for my feedback often and does not micromanage me. He said to other managers and CEO he trusts my work. Last month during performance review I had my salary increased again, that's twice in one year.

At work I have managed to be relatively successful, but all my career I have had a background minimum, and then full anxiety while I’m in a meeting or working on a project that I somehow scammed my way here and I’m waiting for someone to call me out. My peers and boss have told me that I just lack confidence, but I feel as if it’s deeper. I have learned over the years to just beat back the feeling or how to stay quiet and nod kind of thing. I try self actualization and try and boost myself all the time. I try to brush it off thinking that it doesn’t matter. 

My personal life I worry that my friends just put up with me. I worry that I’m just a bother to people. I worry I’m weird. They tell me I’m a great guy, and that I’m fun. Just like my work I try all the tricks and they work to a point. But my mind never stops. I can only escape in media. A book, a movie, tv, games, etc. anything to forget myself. 

My wife. God I love her. I would do anything for her. But I worry she married me because I was the safe bet, or because I made good money. Nothing nefarious mind you, but again I worry the next thing I say she might laugh or even get mad at me. She has never been that way towards me, it still it’s there…

I dunno do I fit the imposter syndrome label. Somehow I’m sure I need to see a doctor about this. I do have internalized manic episodes of happiness, anger, sadness, and depression. They come and go.

2494,"The title summarises most of this but basically, I get a lot of compliments from people. Like a lot a lot. I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre. Not to say there's anything wrong with being average, I don't mind it,  but,  well,  yeah, I'm average. Yet everyone insists I'm not. It's gotten to the point where I assume that it's because of my disability.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends.

The program coordinator told us that it is ok if we do not have much experience on those things I don't know, and the instructors will give a brief introduction at the beginning of the term.

2501,"I’ll try to make this quick. I’m a 20 year old birth doula. If you don’t know what that means, it’s a female-only non-medical support career for women giving birth. I’m trained in physical comfort measures, methods such as hypnobirthing, mediation/emotional support, and advocacy for my clients’ decisions about their labor and birth.

This is a field that has just recently started to grow in popularity, and despite how simple it may sound, certification is a long, hard process. I’m extremely passionate about the importance of birth and how the idea of it has been corrupted to seem like a medical emergency in every scenario, and modern hospitals routinely abuse mothers in labor. My desire to change this has kept me going for 2 years. I’m completely trained, yet still uncertified due to the last steps being hands-on experience among other things. The pandemic has kept doulas out of hospitals, making it extremely difficult to find clients for my 3 certifying births, especially as a brand new doula. 

Recently, I’ve taken some steps that have finally led 3 clients to contact me. I’m aware that all three are mostly interested in my low fee, which is less than a third of what experienced and certified doulas charge. Regardless, I need these 3 births to get certified and begin growing my practice. 

Working with a doula client involves both gathering all information about their pregnancy, birth history, desires for their birth plan, and health information, as well as educating the client on certain decisions, comfort measures, procedures, and birth physiology. There are generally two prenatal meetings preceding the birth and one postpartum meeting afterwords. I’ve held two meetings for different clients. 

It’s overwhelming having little guidance while jumping into such a large career. No one tells you how to run a prenatal meeting. Your textbook knowledge has to be accurate and unbiased. You have to be intuitive to a laboring woman’s needs when she can’t express them verbally. You need to be an expert at active listening and mediation without any personal input or advice.   You need to have thick skin and be open to rejection and criticism from doctors, nurses, clients, other doulas, midwives, and close-minded people who believe there’s a “right” way to give birth. 

With the lack of support, training, and insight, I slaved over creating an itinerary with minuscule help from Google and a few of my birth books before I ran my first meeting. This is where it gets tough. I know the meeting went well, but I still went home and cried. No matter how much I prepare or how well I know I’ve done, I can’t make myself believe I actually belong here. After my second meeting, I was 100% convinced that the couple wanted nothing to do with me. That they’d opted out of wanting a doula after all and they would just ghost me. Of course, this was not the case but it seemed so real in my head. 

At one point, I made an Instagram post about the importance of skin to skin contact directly after birth to meet my “one social media post per month” quota for a local doula group I’m in. A midwife dm’d me, disagreeing with a claim I made about newborn discomfort in the birth canal. I’d read about this fact before and it was even brought up in my initial doula training. I was sure I was correct, yet I was sent into one of the worst spirals of self-hatred of my life. I’d never felt so incompetent. My thoughts had never been scarier. I was convinced that everyone I had status with had seen the post and disagreed with it and I was now the laughing stalk of the area. I then pinned this idea to the itinerary of an upcoming meeting with my doula group, and I was convinced one of the topics was added because of my post. I emailed the leader of the group (actually it turns out I emailed THE ENTIRE BOARD) with a panicked message about how sorry I was. She had no idea what I was talking about and I completely humiliated myself as a new, inexperienced member.

Just today, I received a text from a client saying she was checking into an appointment with her midwife that I had agreed to attend. I’d forgotten to put it on my calendar, and I was currently tied up with one of my 3 other jobs, which was nannying my infant nieces. I had to explain the situation and apologize profusely and I could tell she wasn’t impressed. I’ve been thrown between beating myself up and distracting myself all day.

Somehow, every time I move forward, I feel like absolute shit. Every time I make a mistake I feel like absolute shit. Every single thing I do makes me want to give it all up because I can never ever be good enough. People tell me I’m born for this field and it’s my calling. This is genuinely my dream career and I want to believe them. Everyone says that every doula is important because we all offer different skills and personality traits. I want to know I’m not just the one exception to that. I’m working my ass off and pouring so much time and money into getting my life started, but I just don’t feel like I’m good enough. I hate this feeling so much. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and confidently learn from my mistakes, but both just make me hate myself. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in therapy and I’ve done all the natural mental health support I can do and nothings changing. I’m terrified for when I actually support my first birth (I’ve attended two as a shadow to an experienced doula but never been the primary.) I’m worried the self-doubt is the only thing holding me back and it’s eventually going to tear me down.

2509,"I'm a wedding photographer in the UK and have done it since around 2014. I started by doing a few friends weddings and it grew from there to where I now have almost 50 weddings a year.  

I used to really enjoy the job and my work but the more I do it, the faker I feel and the more I worry. I feel that I've marketed myself really well rather than people booking me for my work itself. I feel that I have a fairly realistic idea of how good I am at wedding photography and while I wouldn't put myself at the very bottom, I know I have a long way to go before I would ever like my own work.   

A couple who live in Canada found my Instagram and have booked me for their wedding in France which is happening in a weeks time. I have never felt more like a fraud in my entire life. The pressure is huge. They are paying me to go to France to take their wedding photos. This is now no longer that I just happen to be a local wedding photographer who knows a local venue well.... this is now a case where someone has found me and could have picked anyone in the entire UK or most of Europe! Why me? My work really isn't that good! It's average at best. I rarely even post on Instagram so I don't even know how they came across my page.   

The pressure of photographing their wedding and delivering their images is now weighing so heavy on my shoulders. I'm already going through a mental battle right now with medical testing for what could be a serious life-threatening disease. The added pressure of now having to go to France next week to photograph a wedding is huge.

I grew up poor in a small town with 3 bipolar siblings and a bipolar father. None of my siblings graduated from high school. All 3 went to rehab in some capacity. Only one isn’t supported by someone else right now. Suffice to say it was rough growing up and I was lumped in with them as never being expected to amount to much.

Fast forward- I graduated top of my class in high school. Via scholarship, a full time job, and student loans I went to a local state school and received my degree cum laude. Landed a great job and a year ago purchased a house with my wife and two dogs.

Today, I went with a colleague to a local country club his family has been a part of for generations. He’s sponsoring me to become a member. 

And I realized that no matter how much money I make or how well I do in life, I will not be looked at as part of “them” at this club. Everyone there went to prestigious schools, drives expensive cars, and is clean cut with no tattoos. I’ve spent so many years reaching for this goal to feel like I really “succeeded” and I now realize it will never be enough. 

Words of encouragement or people with similar experiences would be appreciated.",trust

She is very streets smart and led the entire group around the city for a tour. I sat back and didn’t do much because I am not really good with things like this. I did behind the scenes work but when they came they didn’t really see it. My skills aren’t very outward and some would say I’m not streets smart at all. I may come off quiet and somewhat ditzy.

Firstly, there seems to be this extremely huge skill disparity in the IT industry. Students belonging to the upper echelon appears to have the prospect to be working at google in the near future. 
Whereas, the bottom feeders compromises of students who were essentially always most useless in group projects. Due to their inability to code, their main source of contribution if any is report writing / presenting. 

Amongst the general cohort, for my school at least, i perceive myself to be a student with an average set of skills. 

However it never seems to be enough, I am constantly living in trepidation that the amount of time i have requested to work for a feature is overly long. 

The constant need to relook old features previously submitted for bugs and issues.

Being fearful of the next new hire or even interns being better at developing than I am despite myself being a full timer with more experience to boot.

Are these worries normal….?

I also dont see myself being able to pass the technical tests conducted by FAANG or even unicorn companies such as grab and shoppee. 

Is it normal to be working in an industry knowing that you are a dispensable fish with thousands of other fishes to choose from. 

It also doesnt help that i still want to be paid a decent amount ( slightly above average )

I wonder if its this stressful for me, how do the bottom feeders from school survive without feeling any such pressure?",trust
2521,"I am currently undertaking a masters degree in mental health nursing and I am honestly convinced that I am the last person on this planet who should be trying to become a mental health nurse. 
I truly believe that I have 0 people skills and ability to connect with others and make them feel better. I believe that I am nasty and horrible and that it’s just better for me to shut up than to say anything.
I am so plagued with anxiety that when I do get a chance to speak semi-comfortably I ALWAYS regret what I said because I was slightly more open and less filtered. there are very few people in this world that I trust that I can be genuine with. 
I try my hardest to be genuine, I am good at doing this via my appearance, but other wise I am a completely hidden behind a wall. I am so overly self conscious about how others will perceive me, that I act in such a plain and well thought out manner. I am so scared of not being liked. 
On my last nursing placement at uni I was SOOOO convinced I was going to fail - I thought I was too shy and anxious and didn’t push myself enough. Turns out I was wrong - the feedback I got from the nurses actually said they would be happy if I can back to work there once I’m qualified. However I still don’t really believe it and think they were just being nice. 
I just can’t shake this feeling that other people are better than me, but it’s awful because I’ve always been this shy person, idk how to fix it and be more open. I also feel like such an imposter caring for people with mental health issues when I am probably so many untreated myself.

2522,"So my understanding of imposter syndrome is pretty limited but I’m pretty sure I’ve developed it.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I’ve done good. I’ve made mistakes, gotten subpar marks like everyone else but I was almost always able to pull it together when it mattered - GCSEs, A Levels, uni exams and assignments. This last year, the last year of my Bachelor’s, I seemed to be on track for a First, with me pulling myself through assignments with First-class marks.

And then I didn’t do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master’s program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It’s always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

Now I’m looking back on everything I’ve done well and it feels like a fluke, a fraud, that I was just lucky and wasn’t really worthy of the good marks and grades given to me. I’ve always been able to pull it together when it mattered but this is when it mattered the most and I didn’t do good enough.

People are saying that a 2:1 Bachelor’s is still good enough but I can’t say how much shame I’ve felt around it. Given my way I WOULDN’T be graduating right now - do you know how shit it feels to have graduation feel like a mark of shame rather than merit?!",trust

2525,"Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this forum. I basically wanted to vent some stuff I've had on my mind the past weekend. So, I graduated recently with my bachelor's in statistics in early May, and I have been job hunting since then until literally a few days ago. I managed to finally get what I would have considered my ""dream job"", a data analyst position at a big company with great benefits and a fantastic starting salary. I truly couldn't believe it when I got the call back that I had finally gotten the job offer after having interviewed countless times and even being rejected once from another company I really wanted to work with.

Now, I struggle with incredibly low self-esteem in general. Although I graduated with the top of my class and had a near 4.0 grade point average, I still considered myself less than adequate for one reason: I had very little relevant work experience. I knew some programming languages sure as was required by my school coursework, but because I was a commuter student I wasn't involved in any fancy professional clubs/orgs, I had no internships in the field to speak of, and when I originally graduated, I was terrified I'd end up in a terrible job I didn't want doing something I was going to be bad at because all I really know how to do was study hard, learn really hard math, and get good grades.

I was and still am shocked as hell I managed to actually get my foot in the door as an official business analyst doing what I had originally went to college to do. But I feel like that initial anxiety I had still hasn't gone away. Now, I'm worried about basically ""fucking it up"". I didn't lie to them about knowing technologies I didn't know, it was obvious from my resume and the stories I chose to tell to them during my interviews that I had no internship experience and was basically a brand new freshie.

I basically just tried to convince them that I knew how to analyze datasets and math and could communicate difficult concepts to people. Which, honestly, I believe I can do. But at the same time, I'm not an expert by any means in any of the softwares I have used. In college, when given the choice to do something with software or by hand, I almost always did it by hand because I just preferred that, and I learned better doing that.

So I guess basically I'm wondering if what I'm going through is the dreaded imposter syndrome I've always heard about in fields such as these. I always felt deep down that I wasn't good enough, and I was shocked anyone decided to give me a chance at all. Part of me wants to tell myself that if they thought I wasn't going to be able to do the job, they wouldn't have hired me. I was a first-generation college student, no one has ever done a job like I'm doing in my family, and I literally have no frame of reference. I feel like I'm in undiscovered territory, and I have no idea what my first day is going to be like and what my manager is going to expect from me for the first few weeks. I just don't want to let anybody down, and I want to be what I have to be. What should I do?",trust

2532,"I battled a brain tumor called a vestibular schwannoma all of last year. It hurt. I was in so much pain, feeling so dizzy like a mix of a bad hangover and the stomach virus. I'd feel intensely weak, confused, and haunted by a vicious ringing in my ear. It was like hearing a bagpipe or teakettle going off in my ears 24/7, while the other symptoms happened EVERYDAY for hours on end, to barying degrees. The vertigo was also terrible. Sometimes I'd fall over. Sometimes I'd have a panic attack while going through it. Sometimes it'd last for hours. It would even keep me from sleeping. Then there are the dangerous situations I was put in because of the loss of balance and loss of hearing 

Due to the COVID pandemic, it was t easy to seek professional medical care. Doctors would make me wait months or even into the next year which I outright refused. I took my own data on my symptoms, my medication, my food, ans the time of day these symptoms happened, all to give insight and remove any extraneous variables as to what was happening. The ER doctors couldnt help me as they didn't find a brain tumor on the CT scan. It wasn't until I got an MRI two months later while going through all of this, that the WNT diagnosed the brain tumor. Not to mention the severe hearing loss in both ears, especially the left.

I saw the best in others and I saw the worst. My mental health suffered while waiting for care. And worst of all the doctors were somewhat dismissive of my needs. It wasn't until I saw a doctor at Duke University Medical Center, one of the most advanced medical centers in the world for skull base tumors, even able to perform operations no other medical center can, that I got real help.

A Vestibular Achwannoma has a high survival rate. Mine wasn't that big at 7mm ans some survive even larger. 

I talk a lot about it on my GoFundMe my friends made, where I post updates and on social media as well.

And yet, a part of me feels like maybe it wasn't that bad. I didn't die. I didn't end up like the others who are worse off than I am today. I felt I was dying and was even suicidal, thinking and plotting ways to off myself that would be considered an accident. I didn't want to live life with the amount of hearing loss I had, the potential for permanent dizziness, ans these tormenting symptoms to continue even after surgery (which the symptoms have since resolved sans the hearing loss).

Maybe I'm a whiner. Maybe I'm not simply updating friends and gsmiyl, but looking for attention. Maybe I shouldn't have spent my GoFundMe donations on more than just medical bills - like a dietician, additional physical therapy, and yoga lessons. All were to help me adjust to life after a brain tumor and improve my almost non-existent balance. But it wasn't specifically necessary, even if it worked.

I know what I went through was real, and nobody else's opinion on the matter has any meaning but mine. Even now, I still talk to a therapist who I've seem throughout this process. She says this is normal for many, these feelings. What I went through was real. Did someone doubt me? Yep, but nobody else sided with those people.

And yet, I sometimes wonder of the worst days of my life were really pain, agony, and loss, or simply exaggerating for help.",fear
2533,"Not sure if this fits in this subreddit, but here we go lol. Short version: I am lazy by nature. However, in February I decided to start working 2 jobs and pay down a bunch of my student loan debt. I also got a job I really enjoy and may have finally found my career path. Because I'm currently so active, every new person I meet thinks I'm some sort of go-getter. 

Long version: I consider myself quite a lazy person because outside of work and exercising a bit, I mainly spend my time playing video games. I'm very introverted, so I don't go out much and meet new people very often, but I have been on a couple of online dating apps, which is where this façade started. I bring up working 2 jobs and I even take a course my current company is paying for, and everyone is really impressed not even on just the apps, but at work too. 

Without going too much into detail, I graduated university about 6 years ago, and for 5 years, I was in a very deep cycle of depression. I moved in with my mother after a big lay off and I was only paying on the interest of a few private student loans, not even making a dent in the principle balance. Late last year though, I decided enough would be enough, and earlier this year I started working a 2nd job and am able to use the money for my student loans. I got a new main job in January and the company is paying for a course for me to take to advance my career, so I'm also taking that. So yes, it seems like I'm active, and in fact I am no longer depressed at all, but I'm only active now to make up for the last 5 years of being a lazy bastard. And honestly, I'm probably going to go back to being lazy once all of my debt is done with and my course is over.

At the same time, I got pissy with a customer because they were asking about a bunch of asinine stuff, so then I spent two days convinced I was going to get fired for pissing off a customer.  And add to it, my mentor asked how I was doing, and I wrote back this 'fear of failure' thing, and then didn't hear back from him...

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.  And my mentor made this long apology about how he should be doing better by me if I feel like a failure, that he loves working with me, etc.

It's all just so tough to believe sometimes...  I'm totally convinced I should be a janitor, that I'm not worth a damn to this company I've been a manager at for nearly twenty years.

Fast forward, after he had cheated on me again we ended up getting divorced, two kids deep. I started dating this guy I considered safe because safety emotionally was my main concern after being cheated on terribly. This man wasn’t safe. I remember him saying, “I’m surprised your waist is that skinny.” “Your ankles are kind of fat.” It was like a load of bricks hit me. Why say that? Why point that out? He was no supermodel and of course I wasn’t scrutinizing his appearance. I just wanted a loving relationship. Fast fast forward. The scrutiny turned into much more. Making fun of me in front of his friends for laughs, hitting in my friends, being angry at me for not indulging him in a threesome, saying it was unfair and that I was effecting his life in an unfair way by withholding. Telling my I was stupid. I was back in college. I graduated with honors and kids in tow. Everything I did I now found myself checking three times to be sure.

I was in a really competitive high school a few years back, and actually managed to get great grades but was seen as the “smart kid” and my friends and teachers judged me a lot if I wasn’t getting into a prestigious program or school or if I did less well on tests which we had every week, and my mental health was really bad as a result. A lot of my friends had really toxic or abusive relationships (platonic romantic familial) and always leveraged off success as their defining “I’m doing better” kind of moment, and it compelled me to do the same even though it was destroying me. Fast forward and I’ve graduated a long time ago and no longer talk to anyone there. 

I’ve noticed that my imposter syndrome has gotten so bad and ironically manifests in little white lies. For example, I’ve been telling people that I got into X university when they ask but decided not to go; but the truth is I didn’t even apply there. I hate how easily little lies like this slip out of my mouth even when meeting new people when they ask, and I really want to stop even though these lies have no effect on serious aspects of my life :( yesterday I met someone new and this slipped out yet again, and it just bothers me so much.

I started a new job and when I joined, I had no idea that a similar counterpart for my role was also hired. “Marisa” joined a month after me in the same role. 

I was already blindsided and confused as to what I would be doing since they hired someone else for my exact role.

Overtime, we’ve gotten to known each other and I think very highly of her and actually very envious of how she talks and her experiences. She seems so smart when she talks, and always has something to say in meetings to contribute. Our executive team really likes her as well. She is just really good at her job. She also does way more than me so I feel like I am not doing anything.

Whenever I talk, I feel so stupid. I don’t sound smart. I say “yeah” and “ok” a lot. I know I’m very introverted - I don’t know why I started such an extrovert-type role. Whenever I contribute an idea, everyone shuts me down. Even our manager that we both report to sides with her all the time and mentions that them two are a team and never says anything about me as part of the team.

I just feel so stupid and feel like I don’t know anything and everyone else thinks I am stupid too. I am feeling such a heavy bout of imposter syndrome. I know I have good experiences and got hired for a reason but I cannot express myself the way I want to. I want to seem confident and talk a lot - but I don’t know what to say.

I’m at one of the best colleges in the world for my major already, make Dean’s List each semester, but feel like a fraud because surely that can’t be me doing this. Everyone simply must be taking pity on me and giving me good grades, or the exams aren’t that hard, or… (You all know how this mental song and dance goes.)

One of the professors has taken an interest in me, getting me a job at a well respected laboratory in my field and is making me her research assistant, a quietly known prerequisite in my program to being referred to a paid trip to Cornell through her as she’s a PhD alumni. She also has said that during that  short time after I graduate I’ll also be heading one of her research projects.

I can’t stand it, I feel so stupid. I keep telling myself there’s no way this is going on, it must be some elaborate prank. Why would she select me when other students get higher grades, or are younger, or have a better background in this academic field?

2557,"Hey everyone, my name is Nick and I have a problem here and my hope is to get some more guidance and help to solving this. My therapist a few months ago said I may suffer from imposter syndrome (I haven’t be diagnosed with it, not sure if it’s even a diagnosable thing). I believe this to be very true and I can back it up with evidence throughout the most recent years of my life in specific. The problem I’m having is that I have proven myself to have the talents and accomplishments of a top trader (top 1% and most likely even higher) but I can’t come to acceptance with them… 

When I was younger I resold sneakers and took a starting investment of $1k up to $100k over the next 3 years. I bought one of my favorite cars and it made me so happy. I mention this as it relates to what I’m feeling now. I have all the proof of my accomplishment and skills in reselling sneakers (my car, my track record of sales, etc). Two years ago I got into trading as a long term and stable career. Right out the gate I achieved great success (just like with selling shoes) but never capitalized on it due to me making mistakes. I have the talent and reuslts based on my performance to scale up to a great $ amount just like I have with shoes but I can’t believe it to be true (Imposter feelings). 

Trading is already very hard as it is but I have proven myself to have a great long term career in this. Things are starting to work out for me now that I haven’t been making mistakes but it’s like I can’t believe the success I have in store for me despite my greats results and proof of this (just like I did when I selling sneakers when I was 15). I’m starting to see the fruits of my labor but my brain won’t allow me to believe it to be true, it feel surreal. I told this to my friends and therapist but I thought I’d reach out and get more help. Thank you for everyone reading and responding!",trust
2558,"Okay so,  the title says it all basically.  I have struggled with IS for years, and generally end up internalizing it.  Mostly due to syndrome making me believe that I am just a whiny baby, not someone with an actual problem worth taking up time, money, and resources to fix.  

This internalizing has lead to countless occasions of hurting the people closest to me because of viewing the world from my skewed perspective as well as sabotaging myself and having to start over in life constantly.

So when the old feeling starting creeping up that I’m not a productive contributor to any facet of life I am in, I decided to speak up for once. I have bosses who are very understanding, a wife who is a saint, and a 4 year old daughter whose pictures I have everywhere and on me at all times, just in case I need a reminder why it’s worth it to keep fighting.  With all this, I can’t afford to “start over”, and thought maybe talking to some of these people I genuinely trust would help me achieve a different outcome this time.

The problem with this is of course, being the good people they are, they were understanding.  Or seemed understanding. But the reality that all of US know too well is they are only handling me with kid gloves because they think I’m a messed up loser who can’t handle reality.

2563,"Hi community. My first post in this community and I am curious about how Imposter Syndrome shows not only in your life but also specifically in relationships. 

About me: I am 37, almost 38, first and foremost a musician who has struggled with performance anxiety and always trying to give my best but then always end up thinking it wasn’t good enough, or that there’s someone better than me. Add in having parents who constantly asked why I wasn’t doing well in college and subsequently thinking they are always judging my every move in life. 

But I think most notably I struggle with my Imposter Syndrome surfacing in my relationships. I am gay and have had a couple significant relationships in my life, my last one being 7 years with someone who I viewed as more successful than me, smarter, etc. I am now entering a new relationship with a very creative person (who has admitted his own struggles with Imposter) but who has that ability to be confident, and show his self so strongly. As this relationship is going I find myself thinking thoughts that tear down every facet of hope in this relationship. And I am madly and deeply in love more and more every day.  Like, “what does this guy want with you, you don’t talk strong like he does, you don’t have strong opinions, you’re not good enough for him, if he really gets to know you he won’t like you, one day he will meet someone else that is better than you” 

I guess I’m looking for ways to cope, to live with this because I don’t think it will ever go away, to survive, to keep going, to love and be free to accept love. Thanks for listening.",trust

I took Counseling Techniques this semester and we do recording assignments to show our proficiency of skills. I did okay throughout the semester, but on the last assignment, I tanked. The Professor said that the assignment I submitted does not show the required level of competency in these skills. I have a passing grade in the class, but I wouldn't be surprised if I am still forced to retake it. 

I feel upset and stupid. I've had these feelings pop up throughout my two semesters. Also, in other classes, where I felt like I didn't belong. I want this career.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone.

People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I’m in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

“You went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.”  
“You’ve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won’t make enough because of it to make that ok”

“Your almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??”

It’s the answer to the last one that makes me realize I’ve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I’ve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I’m a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn’t know I just couldn’t hack it academically, even though I’ve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn’t worked, it’s because those around me wouldn’t let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fiancé before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn’t let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

2583,"In finite games (or games where there is a goal, a winner and a loser, and set boundaries), the prize is a title (whether that is being a gold medalist, getting a promotion, or being a degree holder). This is in contrast of infinite games, where there are no winners, and the point of the game is to keep the game going (for example, the game of literature, the game of science, and the game of music). 

Imposter Syndrome typically occurs to me, and maybe some of you, in school or at work (both in which are finite games). The titles that we earn in finite games are titles symbolizing the accomplishments of the past. Having a Harvard degree symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Becoming a director symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Getting a gold medal symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. These titles are not about the present, but the past! These titles are a form of credit that tells the world that we did well in the past; the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Possibly, anxiety from Imposter Syndrome comes from having the titles but being unsure about our capacity to hold up to the expectations of these titles.

How does one hold up to the expectations of these titles? One possibility is to do well enough... in which you later get another title. And then the cycle repeats itself. You can have your high school degree, your bachelors, your masters, and you can be part of the C-suite, and still have Imposter Syndrome. 

My proposed solution, and I know it's easier said than done, is to let go of the expectations and trust that we've been appropriately given the title. There is no way that *all* these people, institutions, and systems were wrong. Since part of the anxiety is not meeting expectations, another thing that can be done is focusing on the present and do the best we can - the chances are that we can meet expectations.

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",trust
2589,"So first off I want to say that I know I’m not stupid stupid but I don’t think I’m as smart as people think I am. I think I give off the impression of coming off as intelligent when in reality, my brain processes things quite slow. I feel like it actually is harder for me to learn a complex subject than my peers, like for example if I’m solving a math problem I am aware that I “should” be able to do this much more efficiently although I always feel as if I am going through extra steps or strain in order to finally solve the problem. I know grades aren’t a indicator of anything but my friends try to tell me I’m smart because I get good grades, but that is only because I spend so much time studying, and anyone would be able to get the grade if they studied that much. My question is, what if I’m actually just stupid compared to others and I’m just good at giving off the impression of being “smart” but they don’t truly know how inefficient my brain works? Sure I like to have deep and philosophical thoughts but “deep” doesn’t mean “smart” and a stupid person can def be “deep”.",trust

Today, during a meeting, my boss asked me if I wanted my boss to run through my department's numbers or if I was OK doing it. I offered to do it just so I could get more familiar. It's my NINTH day, so of course I don't have it all down pat, and it showed. But guess what? They were still pleased. And then they moved on.

My little voice cropped up saying, ""You idiot - see? Now they all know you're a phony."" But I stopped myself and quickly rewrote the narrative - I was asked to do something on the spot I hadn't been prepped for, given the option to not do it, chose to do it for a logical reason, and didn't do it as smoothly as I will once I get my legs under me - yet I STILL met expectations. Because I'm good at what I do.

I didn't ""fumble"" because ""I'm an inherent failure."" I experienced a very normal situation and nobody batted an eye.

2599,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don’t know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I’m so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my “thing”, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can’t you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your “thing”?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I’m not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I’m saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can’t I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I’m a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking. I feel like I am just not the type to succeed. And so I’ve decided that I want to start investigating instead of feeling this pressure in my chest and trying to logically calm myself.

2601,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

2605,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I have my Master's in industrial engineering but I have no clue how to put any of my textbooks to use. Feeling so confused on what to do, and I shouldn't be at all.

I don’t feel like I could possibly get an opportunity this good. Why would they pick me? Undoubtedly I have peers that are just as smart if not smarter. They obviously will realise that before July or something totally improbable like the position just being eliminated from the organisation.

since I was a kid, I push myself to achieve. my family is not wealthy so I push so hard to get scholarships. entered high school, college, and my masters free.

now, all this education and credentials dont help me feel more secured. if any, it makes me feel more pressured. I feel I just got lucky.

whenever we have team meetings, Im so hesistant to speak up. I have a technical background, but I feel insecure to dive in the discussion even though my teammates are very supportive and most of them are non technical people.

I feel like if I dont overcome this, ill be stuck. ill never be able to reach further and be who I want to be.

While I was at the office before this pandemic, I had these thoughts that maybe I am not good enough for the job requirements but they were not so active because my co-workers are great and my boss keeps having great conversations with us which makes me feel comfortable at work. Now, by working remotely, conversations with other co-workers are not so frequent and that makes me think everybody is working harder than I am. 

I also had this feeling that my supervisors are constantly looking at the chat to spot if I am online or not and whenever I did a break, I felt guilty and I tried to be back at work as soon as possible because my brain kept telling me ""Your boss probably has already called several times and you are here....having lunch.....pffff, you really do not deserve this job"". 

Well, once I started to ignore these thoughts and take my time to have lunch or to have a conversation with my family, I felt much better. Not only because when I got back to work I had no message or call asking for my assistance but also because I understood that whenever I sent a message to someone at the company, they would take their time to answer and I would think that maybe they are too busy to answer me at the moment....so why shouldn't they think the same about me if I take some time to answer as well?

2658,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you’re succeeding, even if you “don’t have the skills,” it’s the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You’re succeeding. It’s the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that’s who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It’s hard to tell internally whether you’re funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You’re not a good judge of that. You’re on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people’s actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it’s so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn’t be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There’s no downside. Even if you don’t “need” it or supposedly don’t “deserve” it, it doesn’t matter, because it’s a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you’ll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don’t know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I’ll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I’ve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I’ve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there’s a more tangible motivator- ‘I really want to have a good day, and it’s statistically much more likely if I’m productive.’ Try it if you’d like. Idk. I didn’t keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain’t real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it’s happening, that’s a fantastic help. It’s even better when/if you’re able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I’m rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you’ll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful. ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

I have a pretty high GPA from having easy teachers and being able to pay my way through assignments, as well as cheating on tests.

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others.

A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",trust
2667,Hello...first poster here.  I have this issue where I don't feel worthy of friendship.  I find myself questioning my friend's motives (even though logically I know they're genuine) of being friends with me.

I guess I just question if I should have the amount of friends/people who care about me...does this count as IS? TIA.,trust
2668,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them. Sorry this is so long, most of you probably won't even get to the end but my point is: is the way I felt about being called a hero imposter syndrome?",trust

I took up a job at a small company and I was happy with it even though the pay wasn't as much. I got contacted by a recruiter for a big Mnc and given that it was the company of my dreams, I immediately took up the offer. 2 yrs into the job I decided to pursue a more managerial role. My work was recognized and I got promoted to a technical manager position. It has been 4 months and I have been dealing with a lot of big bosses and colleagues in much higher up positions and with a lot more experience than I have. 
I feel I am not qualified enough to talk to them either at a technical level or at a managerial level. I overthink and keep making what I think are mistakes. I don't know what others think of me and I feel stressed out just thinking about it. I want to know if I am going in the right direction and I have scheduled a meeting with my boss regarding this.

The most recent example was that her company laid off her entire team (8 people), but kept her because, well...she’s awesome! This morning she was telling me that she’s basically not good enough for this role among other thing. She was also perturbed that some of the district managers that she worked with previously have not wished her good luck with the new role. And it irritates her.This was after many, many, other people complimenting/congratulating her.

She is finally seeing a therapist and her therapist diagnosed her with IS. I am diagnosed OCD and I know I do things that annoy her, but she does whatever she can to help me, so how can I help her? 

I get so frustrated that she’s verbally harming herself when it comes to her job and other things she does (like decorating the house). I tell her genuinely that I think she is amazing and I just kind of get to a boiling point where I don’t know what to do and we start arguing. Please help!

She thinks she will get fired sometimes to, but they keep promoting her lol. I’m just so proud of her! And she has such a big heart for an aggressive hard worker too!

And currently, I'm up to my eyeballs in that dread because the time has come. I have my job.

And that job just so happens to have me in the most toxic work environment I've yet encountered, which has supercharged my impostor syndrome far beyond its original state because the negative inner voices now have external validation. I've spend the last three months feeling doomed and inadequate; that it's only a matter of time before I'm outed and my future is permanently ruined.

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly. Sometimes if I have a backup or another I feel more comfortable using it. What made me realize it is my laptop, the surface pro 3 I got 5 years ago I've always felt weird using it, but now that I was just given the pro 7 for Christmas I feel way more comfortable using the old one because I know if it breaks I'll have another chance. (poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

Also last night going to bed I had the thought, ""I can't believe I'm not homeless"". A huge part of my imposter syndrome rn is being mostly financially dependent on my mom and not having financial independence yet.

Someone's I'm scared that I'm still doing this unintentionally and it takes a bit of the enjoyment out of things.

For example: My friend, Dylan, really likes unsettling and weird art videos. Like Jack Stauber or u m a m i. Before we became friends I used to just skip past these kinds of things. I was pretty indifferent towards them. But after a conversation that I had with Dylan about them, I love them. Feel almost that I have no right liking them.

I am struggling with intrusive and negative thought about myself for more than 4 years now and I just can’t deal with it no more. I want to reduce my symptoms but I have yet failed to do so. There is a naut in my reasoning and I need to undo but I need help.

So I consider myself pretty lucky. I have good parents, I have always done good at school during childhood. I guess I always had an underlying anxiety issue because at age 15, I could bare a break up and tried (unsuccessfully-thanks lord) to end my life. This depressive period change something in me because I started to put way more importance and attention to my grades. In college, I was often 20% above average in my class, gpa (R score) way above the mean. Yet, I always aimed to get higher, never satisfied. Always giving more than requested in evaluations, making myself almost on the verge of burn out but the adrenaline kept pushing me. In my music recital, I would cry or get mad after my performance because I made mistakes I didn’t do when rehearsing, my music teacher feeling bad for me. When I did good, I always felt awkward, putting it on chance, trying to hide/deviate the conversation.

Then last year, I got in the undergraduate program I wanted (cognitive neuroscience) and everything got worst. I’m (now doubting) aiming to enter a PhD program, so does the majority of my 500 classmates, but only 12 places are available. The teachers had to put fire under our ass : “grades are not enough”, “you need to have above 4/4.3 of gpa, get hundreds of hours in research and clinical experience, win scholarships, publish”. I got scared, but for real, but I already knew this : before even starting my program I had already contacted researcher to join their lab. Week 2 of my bachelor : I had researcher assistant position. But I felt like a total incompetent and intrude. I never been in a lab in my entire life, didn’t pass a single exam and I got it almost first shot. So that was both scary and unpleasant. When I went to ask a question on a programming class to my neuroanatomy teacher for my job, he told the entire class (250 persons) that “one of your colleagues already had a research job so everyone of you should hurry up because place at PhD are limited”. The entire class released a surprise “ahh.. omg” I was humiliated (my ears turned red), wanted to burry myself 6 feet under. But now I felt the pressure, because my classmate started to recognize me.

1 year later, I got coauthorship for an article published in A famous Journal. I don’t feel I own it : I feel like an intrude. I didn’t wrote a single line of it, I was just there to help with the analysis, put comments and correct it. I feel like it was a huge gift from the postdoc and director that mentor me. The article got accepted in first round because he did an incredible work. Not only it is rare to publish as an undergraduate : it is rare to publish it that journal and it is rare that it get accepted first round. I feel uncomfortable. I feel now the bar is set so, so high. Failure is at my door and I’m scare to disappoint them. My director wants me to prepare a presentation on my “perspective on my first redaction experience, and give tips to trainee” (when I’m the youngest trainee in the entire team). I legitimately don’t know what to say: I feel and felt like an intruder for the entire process.

My classmates and colleague relly heavily on me and seem to except that I know everything, but I don’t. My director gave me a graduate level project to take over and I’ve been freezing for 3 month because I don’t know how to manage it. I don’t even know what I want to do of my life anymore but I feel I have to act like I do, at least for being a model to my classmate that don’t stop asking me question to get to my position. but I have almost no one my age to rely on in return. Mentor already projecting me publicly growing in academia but I feel stupid and so not creative compare to them.

2705,"On a different Reddit group reframing came up and I wanted to share. Hopefully, it will add some value to someone. 

One of my professors in school would have me do reframing techniques and keeping a diary. It was a way for me to stop doubting myself so much, realize what I've accomplished and the value I've created.  The process reframed how I looked at some situations and how I looked at myself. 

I recently did this in a roundabout way. I hired someone to do a bio, career history for me for a professional reason. I couldn't see all that I had accomplished myself and was struggling to see myself beyond the tasks I had carried out. As I was working with this person and the questions they asked I realized I needed to reframe again because I had lost sight of my value and validity.

Reframing is a technique that can help us refocus our feelings of inadequacy and create a balanced mental model of how we perceive ourselves or situations. Below is a link to an online interactive app that allows you to reframe.  

Use this to realize failure is a learning opportunity and reaffirm your success, validity, accomplishments, contributions and value. Also if you have other ideas you want a different perspective on this tool can help. I don't know who created it I was just looking for a reframing worksheet and found this instead.

2708,"I am a person with pretty serious anxiety, depression, ADHD and imposter syndrome of some sort. Usually my symptoms/behavior are pretty manageable. But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.
* The usual imposter stuff--""everyone at work finds me annoying/doesn't want to work with me, I don't belong there,"" etc. etc. etc.

Does anyone have resources, techniques or methods to help deal with these delusions? I would like to tell my therapist about them, but he has not been super helpful so far, due to his busy schedule and tendency to medicate instead of digging deeper into what is wrong with me.",joy

2714,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me “there were people who did not want to employ you” and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either “I think you are an idiot” or “you are now fired”. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of “I am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...”. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn’t 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It’s silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don’t remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager’s manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I’ve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it’s ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",trust

The company, the owner, the department heads, and nearly everybody else is happy, super polite and nice, upbeat every day, Type-A, and really fucking smart. I didn't think I had any business, much less skill and social skills at all, to be working with so many people like that.

I was anxious, depressed, nearly throwing up every morning before work for months and months, and thinking I might be fired at any moment once they discovered that I was a fraud and not as smart as they thought I was at my interview.

I felt like such a fish out of water for the first year, at least, before I started to even get a little bit comfortable. Even then I only felt like I was barely holding my head above water with the knowledge that I gained of the software I had to support on a daily basis.

Every quarter, we have a full company meeting, this last one being held virtually today due to the shit going on right now. Before each quarterly meeting, everybody in my department submits a nominee from within our group to be employee of the quarter.

This morning, at our virtual meeting, it was announced that I had been chosen as Employee of the Quarter from my service department.

2719,"First off I enjoy social media. I really only use instagram and I never take it too seriously. My posts are all things that I genuinely want to post. From artsy pics to blurry pics that could've been better but it's whatever no biggie, to a meme here and there. I could care less about ""what my feed looks like."" I think it's hella sad how far people will go to have not only an aesthetically pleasing picture but an overall aesthetically pleasing profile.

One thing that I really like doing is posting music on my instagram stories. I usually do it when an artist has released a new song or I'll simply share a song that I'm extra feelin at that particular moment.

My thing is, I love music, I love the culture that it itself is and that it creates around it. I especially enjoy rap hip hop music. I've had friends ask me history questions about music such as NWA and stuff like that and in all honesty I won't really know all of it. I just listen to music and feel it. For as much as I'll listen to songs on repeat, I really suck at remembering lyrics and being able to sing along. Makes me feel like my love for it isn't genuine.

I'm in school and am now gonna actually commit myself, during my free time, to reading the history behind some of my favorite artists as well as the history of where it all began. There's just so much content and music out there. I love Lil Wayne, but I felt so bad a few nights ago when some friends and I were vibin to some old Lil Wayne songs, and my friend just outta nowhere knew all this history surrounding Lil Wayne and stuff like how he was the first and maybe only artist to have a #1 hit on Billboard while serving a prison sentence. I love Lil Wayne, I listen to his music everyday, when I work out, while I'm making my morning coffee. But yeah I just feel awful that I don't know his history. In all honesty, this goes back to there being so much content, I'm 23 years old, I grew up listening to Lil Wayne and those big artists back in my day, but in truth I've never really listened to 50 Cent song or Jay-Z song. Jay-Z?? I've only listened to maybe one or two of his songs. I love Kanye West's music but in truth I've also only heard just a handful of his songs as well, never sat through a whole album.

I’ve been a professional musician for 5 years now. In terms of performing, I have worked past my feelings of feeling inadequate. At this point it’s audio engineering and teaching that are a struggle for me.

As a teacher I’ve been teaching online since 2018. I have nothing but 5 star reviews, but I feel like I don’t have enough for my students. I went to school for music and think I’m reasonably well trained, but I have this anxiety that with each student at some point I’m going to run out of helpful things to tell them and I’ll just be getting paid to sit with them while they practice. I often get nervous during my lessons that students feel I’m wasting their time, but they come back from week to week. 

As an audio engineer I also started in 2018. I did not have a ton of experience, so I charged a small fee and did the best I could. I did NOT go to school to become an audio engineer, but decided to do it after college. I’ve took an intensive course helping me to feel more confident in my tracking, editing, and mixing abilities, as well as joining an online cohort for 6 months to get feedback on my work. I’ve put in time and I’ve had the opportunity to work with some great clients... but I am going to be working with a group signed to Warner Bros. and I just feel like I’m not worthy. I forced myself to take the opportunity, but I am really nervous about it. I am also working on an album for a vocal band right now and feel like I’m not doing them justice, despite saying they’re loving the product thus far.

I feel like I mess up a lot with the technology and question if I’m actually meant to be at this job. I’m worried I won’t live up to the expectations even though I had a meeting with a colleague the other day and she didn’t express any serious concern with how I was doing. 

I don’t know. I just wish this constant second guessing would go away and that I didn’t need to validate my experiences and intelligence constantly because it’s a battle I face in my own head. The second guessing leads to a lack of motivation because I don’t feel good enough then it becomes a viscous cycle of feeling inadequate then putting things off because I don’t trust my abilities enough.

2755,"I (25F) literally got my Masters in Industrial Engineering 2 weeks ago. I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from 3 years ago, but I was never good at the major to land a job. Given my recent accomplishment, I'd be impressed with myself if I didn't feel aimless. (Don't get a graduation either. So I wonder if it even matters.)

Most of the jobs I've applied for I've either been rejected from or haven't heard anything in weeks. Or I'm just not qualified because I don't have experience. Or I don't have the security clearance for them. 

I'm fortunate to have a part-time job, but no upward mobility as my division isn't hiring. Come to find out today that some other guy in another division just got his Master's at the same time and was hired full-time this Tuesday. I just feel embarrassed and really discouraged. 

I feel like I'm fuming. Like I'm Lisa Simpson begging for attention or encouragement after not being at school for a week.

But for some reason I still don't feel good enough. I am scared that people won't think my salon is legit enough because it's in my home...but so many other groomers do it from home and are so successful and people love them, so I don't know why I feel like this. 

I don't want to seem unprofessional. I don't want people to feel that I am untrustworthy enough to leave their pet with me. I know I am overthinking this, but I hope that I will get into the swing of things soon, and this awful feeling of inadequacy will go away!",joy

My job can be VERY stressful and risky and needs lots of split-second judgments sometimes. I made one, I can back it up, but it caused conflict and I was prob not 100% in the right in how I did it...which leads me to start doubting myself completely. And there was another tense convo where I had to advocate for myself when I was getting some pushback earlier this week...which is tough for me to do as a person, but it made me second guess myself as a professional. But again, I thiiink I’m doing the best I can there, and if it’s an issue, it’s more about my approach vs efficacy (like getting a deep tissue massage vs reiki). 

It seems this is more a gripe-post than anything. I have felt like I’ve sucked all my life but got awards when I was in school and tons of praise and referrals in my work and good feedback from many clients. But I can sometimes recognize I’m skilled and competent. Sometimes.

I just don’t know if I need to step away from my profession sometimes because my self-doubt doesn’t seem fair to my clients. Who am I to think I can actually help them? Especially when I get that outlier criticism, it just hits right in the sore spot. And it hits so hard I don’t know if I can even handle continuing in a job that feels so Important.

Last night I met my SO's parents. They're well-to-do: Wealthy, accomplished, connected - the whole bit.   
They were completely warm and welcoming and the evening was fine. 

Although they are not in the least bit pretentious and did nothing to elicit these feelings, I left feeling inadequate and ashamed. I left feeling small. 

I am smart and have a career trajectory that I know people find impressive. In theory, I belong. But even so, I felt so much less than them. Honestly, afterward, I wanted to curl up into a ball. 

It's hard to divorce the person you are today from where or how you grew up. 

No amount of wealth or success seems to alter that internal, mental image of yourself as that kid from that not-so-great family. 

As I spend more and more of my personal and professional time with increasingly affluent, privileged people, I come to realize all that I didn't have growing up. It comes in waves, all things I do not know. Sometimes it's the small things (a butter keeper - what's that?) and sometimes it's the larger things, all the social norms of the classes above me that I'm still learning. 

I worry I stick out like a sore thumb. I worry I'm not worth the same as these other people. But then what is the worth of a human life? I know it's more than butter keepers and Ivy League educations. But why does the lack of those things sometimes hurt so badly, create such feelings of inadequacy?",sadness

2768,"My tutoring company has been doing remote work due to COVID, and they are starting to look into some in-person tutoring, given that both the client and tutor are comfortable. I have the option of being an in-person tutor again, in which I get paid a little more. I'm not personally scared of COVID from tutoring, so I am considering it. I worry though about being a good enough tutor. And so far the two students I've had who switched tutors—I'm assuming because they didn't like me—were ones I went to see in person, as opposed to in the office or remote. 

If I may vent, I was academically successful until college, at which point, I got by. I mean, I went to a prestigious STEM school and graduated in good standing with a BS in CS-Math. I think I got honors in CS. And I love helping people, tutored on-campus, and even tutored young kids over the phone. So I'm capable.

However, I'm not confident. And I don't do well under pressure. Like once I was doing an interview, I was asked to calculate the value of 5/8 without a calculator. I said 1.6 or something. At which point, the interviewer guided me to the realization that 5/8 is less than 1, so how is 1.6 reasonable?

I've had my tutoring job for less than a year. But I have been in it for over half a year, so I think I'm past the ""oh, you're new, mistakes happen"" phase. I believe I have the foundational knowledge I need, but I don't think I have the... sufficient knowledge that other tutors seem to have to confidently answer any kid's question. I find myself often saying that I need to get back to a kid on that. I don't know all the answers, despite having resources, answer keys, and time to plan. Nor am I motivated to give even more time to learning as I have already. 

So I feel like an imposter. Either because I am less competent than my fellow tutors or because I don't want to put in the effort I'd need to be as competent as them. 

Yesterday, I had one remote lesson to teach in the evening. All day I'd been anxious about it. It wasn't horrible anxiety, but it was present. And the lesson was fine. I expected it to be fine. But I still felt scared. 

I feel like an imposter. And I don't like it. But this tutoring job is so flexible and has such a respectful community, that I don't think I should give it up. If something feels wrong, I figure I must be at fault. 

tl;dr I do feel like an imposter. I think I just wanted to vent. If anyone has advice, that'd be cool, too.",trust

These guys were natural born NERDS and I am not. I didn’t even know I wanted to be an engineer and I felt so out of place, but I stayed in the program (even got an A in my Calc 2 class) with a 67% attrition rate. 

I graduated high school and am now about to begin college classes that scare the living shit out of me, and the confidence that I thought I would get from such success in high school is fading. I’ll list out my courses for this fall semester (online classes because of COVID): Introduction to materials science engineering, Calculus 3, logic and computing devices ( and a lab that goes along with that class), electrical engineering (and a lab that goes along with that class too), and Biology for bioengineers. 

The fear that I am not cut out to be an engineer has manifested in my brain for too long.

 My bf says “that’s what school is for — to train yourself for the career you want”, but my immediate reply to him is that “school, for me, is to figure out that I am not good enough ”. 

I don’t have any rational reason as to why I am not good enough to be an engineering, but I really truly do feel like I am not good enough.

It's the sort of career where you learn on the job by speaking to other people and working with them. In short, you need to network like a fox. But I can't ask for help. If I did, I would be too terrified to be ridiculed and torn down because it's so obvious that I don't know what I'm doing and I would be exposed as a fraud, a pathetic laughing stock and a failure. But I need to ask for help to learn the skills to do my job. It's a vicious cycle. I grew up in the care system surrounded by narcissistic people and jaded social workers who just wanted to end the conversation and go home for their dinner instead of giving a shit about you or their job. Their favourite word was ""no"". Aiming to achieve anything other than working in a minimum wage job and living in a crap one bedroom flat was discouraged. So I had to go into every single meeting with them every 6-8 weeks feeling armed to the teeth for battle and it was exhausting. If I wanted or needed something I would have to plan an entire TEDx talk to get through it and if they found one single area in my idea that wasn't quite developed yet, they would be like ""AHA!"", and jump right in there to tear me down and keep me under their boot. I was constantly reminded of how I was a stupid little girl living in a fantasy world and had no idea what I was doing or what reality was. They would straight up make fun of you.

You weren't allowed to do anything for yourself (and there were often consequences when you tried to) and then at a certain age, they expected you to just magically be able to do it.

I don't want them to laugh at me if I want to make films and have no idea where to start. If I try to overwhelm myself by doing everything, I fail.

&nbsp;


Last year I was offered a Leadership/Management Internship position at Walt Disney World - something that I have worked towards since my high school grad in 2011! I was placed into housekeeping leadership though I had no prior experience in it (all my leadership experience was front desk or merchandise) so I felt like I was thrown into unfamiliar territory. 


&nbsp;


I was there for about 6 months (internship was for 1 year and a potential permanent position was available at the end of it), assisted in opening a new resort, and about 3 months in I began to have extreme anxiety attacks at work - I would lock myself in my office and cry and have trouble catching my breath. The role as a leader wasn’t difficult per se, the role itself was something that I could do on a day to day basis. I told my parents and my s/o that I was out-of-place, that I missed guest interaction (there was little to no daily guest interaction unless there was a guest to apologize to), and that I felt like I didn’t fit in.


&nbsp;


Whereas those were all the truth, I feel like I didn’t tell them the full truth. I am extremely terrified of failing and letting people down. I felt like in a position of leadership at this level, I had so much daily weight put on me and I was scared I would fail (even though I had only received praise from my peers and those above me). Eventually I was struggling to get out of bed for what was meant to be my “dream job”, or at least the start of it. I began to question what I wanted to for so long. I left that position and took a general merchandiser position (non-leadership) within the parks and now I feel so unfulfilled but worried to try to step into a leadership position. I’m not even sure what I’m looking for...advice or validation? I’m terrified of applying for another leadership position in fear that this will happen again..I have no idea.

2790,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

2791,"Hey there, new to Reddit here but made an account after finding this thread cause I need advice and also to rant a bit.

SO... I am going into my senior year of undergrad and I recently won executive board (eboard) president of my student organization, an org that connects international and domestic students on campus to learn from each other's cultures blah blah, it's really cool. This is the club's 3rd year. I was a very active member during my first year which was its first year. Then last year I was away the whole year on a study abroad program. I attempted to keep in contact as much as possible but I also wanted to enjoy myself abroad.  I had never given much thought into running for president but I knew I was very interested in being a part of the eboard; I wanted to help make decisions and be more involved in the club. So I had told the current president to let me know when elections would be and I would send in a video. THEN corona fucked us all up and I ended up having to come home early and the university and the club were obviously shut down too.

A few weeks after things had settled down a bit, I got an email saying that eboard elections would be happening soon. But there was one thing, I wasn't sure what I wanted to apply for. I knew I  didn't want to be the treasurer cause I'm not the best with money, but other than that I wasn't really sure. So I asked the current president, who was also a pretty good friend.  He texted back right away saying that I should run for president. I thought he was crazy, I didn't have any leadership experience and I can be pretty introverted. But I do have quite a bit of experience with cultural exchange and am super passionate about this club and cultural competency. So when elections came around I ran for president. I put a good amount of effort into my video for the club to watch and vote on.

As I waited to hear the results, it was then I realized I did NOT want this position. I had not been there this entire last year and hardly knew what new changes had occurred. I didn't have many new ideas of my own. I did not know how to lead people. Like AT ALL. I do not know how to delegate, I don't know how to plan things. And the thought of leading the meetings and yearly planning absolutely terrified me.

So the day comes, I won. I still have no idea how. I have two VPs and honestly they are both more qualified than me. One was on the eboard last year and the other works in the international student center and has been a very active member for the past two years. Both of them are also pretty extroverted and have lots of ideas for the club.

We've had a few meetings together now and I just feel like I am not bringing anything to the table. I am supposed to be the one telling people what to do and when but my brain just feels so jumbled with self doubt and pressure to keep up an image of something I know I'm not. I can feel myself not matching up to the two VPs. They constantly bring up things we should be thinking about and planning for and I feel so stupid having not thought of them myself. They also keep saying, ""last year the eboard would..."" and it just keeps reminding me that I wasn't there.

I'm scared that as time progresses I am just going to fuck up a club that I'm really passionate about. It feels like I'm walking into a final exam that I never even attended any of the classes for.

I guess I'm asking myself, and you're probably wondering as well, why I even ran for president. Well, I supposed it's because I wanted to be on eboard and this is the first thing that was suggested to me. I wanted to gain leadership experience but how can I do that when I constantly feel like I'm not bringing anything useful to the table and feeling so so lost on what to get done, who to talk to, when to plan what, and what I'm supposed to say to people.  I've never felt worse imposter syndrome in my life. I don't know how I'm going to keep this up for the year.

Anyone have any advice on leading people when you have no idea yourself?",trust
2792,"I guess I just need to get this out and see if this mirrors anyone else's experience.

Or if I'm just completely out of my mind.

My therapist definitely believes I have impostor syndrome. This is based on some information I explained to him. In my classes (senior in college), for example, I received an A on both term papers for both courses last term, a 97% and a 98%. And I am still waiting for the grade to be lowered because SURELY these professionals have to figure out that it's all fraudulent. The school I go to uses turn it in and I am able to see my results, both had low %s meaning the content was original, yet I'm still convinced somehow I must've cheated on the assignments. Logically, I know I did not, I remember the painstaking and grueling hours reading the research, putting them together and writing it out in the APA format. I also did well on the quizzes. I can't fathom that I have gotten those grades on my own but I know, logically, I did.

I am also a community activist locally. I don't do anything major or impressive--but it requires me to confront politicians and community leaders with a ton of stats and facts. I am known for my skills in researching and strategy on these topics. I am by no means a mastermind. But I am often able to cite case studies and statistics --yet, even though I've done the hours of research, written them down into an essay, presented them and even have had them double checked, I constantly have to re-check the information before speaking on them again, as I am convinced I have them wrong or made them up. 

This all sounds like impostor syndrome to me--but the part that I never hear about it and I wonder if anyone else deals with this or if its a totally different ""syndrome"". I don't just expect to exposed as a fraud, I expect to be exposed as a horrible human being. I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, most of which I've at least made an effort to atone for, but I am constantly waiting for my ""horrid actions"" to bd exposed--and often times, they are imagined actions or they are based on real events but ""modified"".

One example and I know this sounds strange: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up 3 years ago (almost). And it was a nasty fight, I was crude and petty. The relationship NEEDED to end. I regret how I ended it. But we made amends for both of our wrongdoings throughout the relationship and while we've maintained a healthy emotional distance since then, when we see each other (pre-COVID) we say hi, we've had some small social media interactions and we've even discussed the end of our relationship. In fact, we respect each other very much and the relationship. Yet, nonsensically, I've ""imagined"" him ""exposing"" me as this horrid person who destroyed his life. I know that's not going to happen and it's not true--but it has become to the point that I actually thought I was going to lose all my friends and my standing in my community over it. But there's no actual basis for this. 

I also am frequently expecting the law to come to me and ""catch me"" for the horrible crimes I've committed. I fear being caught, but not for anything I've done, but rather, that I'll be ""planted"" and charged. Now, I am a community activist but not high level enough to worry about that happening.

All of this is based on non-sense. And I have not been diagnosed with anything like psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't have auditory or visual hallucinations. But I am constantly surrounded by guilt and feelings of inadequacy, which I believe is beyond the average persons standard of self-doubt and insecurity.

Thank you for letting me share and I know I sound ""crazy"". If you have any advice or resources, or similar stories (even if you would prefer to share them in a private message), I'm here to listen.

Well about 2 months back my account started to explode, and I have around 15,000 followers now and half of my income comes from commissions.

2798,"I am new to this sub but I wanted to throw a suggestion out. One of the pieces of advice I received about managing imposter syndrome was to keep a running list of positive feedback, accomplishments (big or small), successes, and compliments to reflect on and help to combat feelings of incompetence and not belonging.  

I wonder if folks on here would find any value in having a weekly thread where everyone could just comment with their weekly successes, accomplishments, or positive feedback received. I was thinking there would be no expectation about what success (etc.) means. Someone could write that they remembered to water the plants this week or they got a B on a paper or someone complimented the way they drafted that email or they felt like they might look dumb but they mustered the courage to ask that question in class anyway. The central idea being that it might help us remind ourselves that we do have skill, we are competent, we do belong. It could be a way for us to support one another as well. 

One potential downside I could see is that if folks are listing their successes it might make someone feel more like an imposter if they don't feel like they have something to contribute. Or with the process of upvoting someone might feel bad because they only got 2 but someone else got 10. But my hope would be that we could all support each other in whatever successes people post whether it seem small or large. If folks are interested we could assess how it's going after a few weeks or so and make sure it's helpful, not harmful.

2801,"I’ve had IS for quite some time and it’s ruined my ability to form relationships with people who just want to support me. I can’t take a compliment or accept their praise and they get frustrated, even verbally angry at me for not “understanding my worth”. This has lead to tension between my mother and I because she always wanted to uplift me and I felt guilty, as she was wasting time and energy on me. I then feel guilty that I’m rejecting love and support when there are a lot of people who are not fortunate enough to have a mother so loving. It’s sends me in a spiral, further enforcing my belief that I don’t deserve anything good, I was just lucky enough to be given a mom like her.

She passed away 7 months ago. I never got to tell her how grateful I am to have her constant support while I was struggling, (with mental illness and sobriety). I miss her more than words can describe.

One thing I hate is people telling me that I’m doing surprisingly well dealing with her death, which I take as a back handed compliment. Shouldn’t I be grieving more dramatically because she was so important to me? Why am I happy sometimes even though she’s gone? Are people expecting me to relapse because of the tragedy? How can people say that they admire my bravery and strength to carry on, especially when I spend hours stuck in the past, trying to remember her?

I feel like I’m only “doing surprisingly well” because I have shoved everything down and I am not working hard enough in therapy to address my grief, I’m only repeating what I’ve read in books or posts of what the stages of dealing with grief look and sound like. I lie about my feelings to everyone, even my therapist. My therapist praises me for not relapsing into self destructing habits, but I feel like I haven’t fallen back on those because I don’t want to disappoint my mom, even though she is no longer here. The idea that I’m “strong” is scary to me. I feel like these compliments create so much doubt in my head, causing me to relapse because that is what is expected of me. 

Through all of this, I don’t have my mom’s unconditional support to fall back on when I feel my life is a sham, I don’t have that one person who loves me no matter who I think or pretend I am. It’s tricky navigating my thoughts and feelings alone and I feel like I’ve been killing myself looking for reassurance from other sources, like my work or social media, so much so that I have neglected working on my relationships with my family, who is hurting too. I don’t want to let them down the same way I let my mom down so many times, nor do I want to have them worry about me, or spend time and energy trying to support me as I will never truly feel validated. They should just continue believing I am “doing surprisingly well” even though I know I am faking it.

2804,"Hi all,

I'm here to share my story and wondering if anyone has any advice... a long post ahead (apologies).

I moved to a new country in mid 2018 with a job in a field I wanted to be in.

Prior to my move overseas, I was doing pretty ok at my job and enjoyed it well enough to keep going everyday.  I entered into the field as a graduate and did pretty well there. My job involves analytical thinking and using numbers on a daily basis. At school, math has never been my forte and I've always felt a sense of anxiety towards it for a number of reasons (e.g shamed in front of peers, parental pressure etc.). However, when I moved overseas and got a job in the same field, things started to go downhill.

The overseas job was fundamentally similar to what I was previously doing, but much more complex and customised work. I was making errors and mistakes on basic stuff. My anxiety increased exponentially and everyday I felt like I was going to be revealed as someone who is incompetent. I did my very best and worked really hard to double, triple check my work but it was a cycle of stress and anxiety as I felt less confident and would catastrophize every situation in my head (e.g. I'm going to get fired then get deported...) Coupled with the fact that my boss was a grammar nazi and had really strong eye for detail... I lasted a year and a half before I was let go.  Self sabotage much!

(I also have to note that my errors never led to any projects fallen apart, nor did we loose any clients over my work. It was the small things that added up to the whole.)

It was a tough time because I felt like an absolute failure. My boss and my colleagues had finally discovered the ""truth"" about me...

I've been lucky to get a job relatively quickly since then as I was already looking for other roles before I was let go, but feel like the situation could end up similarly if I don't change and overcome this ASAP. I've already found myself making a few simple errors and this has triggered some anxiety again.

I'm working through some parts of it through a therapist (there's a host of other issues relating to self confidence and childhood trauma which are all connected), but not sure if I can financially sustain it in the long run.

There are a few things I have been working on to try and manage and stay in control.  For example, I'm actively trying to improve my mathematical ability regularly, keep a check list of 'must-dos', exercising regularly to manage my thoughts. Since going into the new job I've tried my best do things differently to what I did before even on simple tasks. I've told my self that it's my 'system of working' that's not working - not a fundamental judgement of my ability and self.

What I do enjoy about the job is that it gives me experience to work on interesting projects and have an impact.

My plan is to stay for a minimum of one year in this new role while I try to find something else.  At the end, perhaps I'm just not suited to this job... Or am I just having a hard time letting go? Am I really an imposter?

Any thoughts or advice to manage all of this? :) It would be really welcomed and appreciated!",trust

Long story short, I’ve realized that there are a lot of mistakes in my paper: calculations, conversions, that my advisor thinks I’ve done (which i did do 2-3 years ago) and these are things I just flat-out have no idea how to do anymore. It seems like common knowledge to just tell my advisor “look, i’m really confused and I regret not asking for more help with this in the years prior. Can you simplify this because I’m just not getting it” (he’s very understanding) but i’m so fearful of disappointing him and I feel so dumb when considering asking “basic” questions because I have no idea what I need to do. Sadly, it’s not like my advisor doesn’t know I have anxiety issues and can get in my own head very easily. I’ve worked for him all through school.

I know I have to ask for help in order to get this done and I only have a bachelor’s degree so i shouldn’t beat myself up about not understanding Master’s/PhD level physics concepts but I cant help it (especially considering i’ve applied to PhD programs recently)

Every time I slip up and hurt someone, even just a little, it feels like I've shattered my façade and theyre all going to discover that I've manipulated all of them into thinking I'm loving and compassionate. I think I am these things... but i'm afraid to trust myself? I don't know what's real. If I'm actually genuinely loving, why do I lay awake at night worrying about being bad?

I forget how to breathe during the performance (and this is a musical, so when I'm singing and dancing and then unable to breathe properly, it just snowballs into a catastrophe), it can be hard to bounce back or even focus on being better because of me feeling as if I don't belong/am not good enough.

It's at the stage where I am sabotaging my career progression and honestly I'm just fed up of feeling shit about myself. I've been in my company 12 years and have consistently been given positive feedback and promotions but it's been made clear to me that my next step will not happen unless I work on my confidence. My IS leads to situations where I am perceived as defensive rather than open to feedback. I find myself getting extremely emotional at positive feedback and in some cases I perceive any negative feedback as a personal attack. I feel this way because I simply don't believe the positives and my stupid brain takes the worst view of the negatives and blows them out of all proportions. 

At the end of the day I don't trust anyone to really open up about all these things to them so I stew and feel worse, more stressed and inevitably undermine myself by getting overwhelmed.

One is honest and gives good review, the other degrades the other persons coding skills (even if they are obviously on the same level) and eventually the downgraded person will start believing that they're really not good enough.

Since the end of my master thesis, I felt like the work I did wasnt good enough or worth enough to be awarded masters and to strengthen that feeling, I lost the goal of my thesis and got drifted to something else which my supervisor didnt correct me either. But at the end of defense, he told he was disappointed and told me what the actual goal is and since I didnt prove that, instead I did something else, he gave me a really bad grade there by dragging my entire masters Aggregate down.

This is just making me feel like I am being an imposter Acting like an engineer while I really am not. To make this worse, after my masters I was working with couple of friends and started a tech startup while the other friends are taking care of Business dev and Marketing, I was the only one taking care of tech coding and such. Every time I integrate a new functionality, I end up with some logic Bugs and I had to debug it line by line to fix it. Not jsut that, everytime I have to integrate some functionality, I had to rely hard on googling stuff and then implementing them. This is just adding to my idea of being an imposter. I feel like I am cheating myself by acting like a tdchie there by cheating my friends aswell. Can anyone help me with how to identify whether I am truly imposter or just being overwhelmed?

Question: how to check whether I am truly an Imposter or just overthinking? Are there any special checklist? Thanks in advance.",sadness

The professor wrote ""expected more"" on the cover of my exam, which made me ashamed of my grade and bad about myself, but not too bad since, considering my situation, it was an ok grade.

Today, I just received my second midterm, in which I got a 73 (class average was 84). Again, the professor wrote ""expected more"" on the cover of my exam.

But my question is this: although I may have deserved the ACT score, does it really mean I’m smart enough to do well in the future? I’m beginning to believe more and more that I’m just good at test-taking, and that I don’t really retain enough information to keep myself afloat in the future (like college and a career). I keep telling myself that that’s just another flaw in the education system, that it promotes the short-term memorization of many subjects rather than the actual understanding of a few. I guess I don’t know why I’m really posting this, especially since the title doesn’t match what I’m talking about, but I suppose I can fix that.

The reason I decided to post this today of all days is that we just started a lab in our college-level physics class. It involves gravity as a concept, but our teacher requires that we not use it in our prediction as we haven’t covered it yet and “don’t know it exists” (I don’t blame him for this, but still hurts). Long story short, I couldn’t think of a way to explain why the objects would behave the way they would using what little we’ve covered so far, and although my group found similar failure, I took the conflicting prior knowledge about gravity and the limited knowledge of physics the hardest, and I just can’t shake the feeling that this will all end in a bad grade in the class. From the lab reports, to the upcoming test (that everyone will  more or less bomb), I’m feeling overwhelmed and starting to think that this is one of a few classes to really represent what college and a career will be like, and making me feel generally ill-prepared for my future. At this point I’ll take whatever reinforcement and good vibes I can get, so thanks in advance, even just for reading.",trust
2875,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr. I learned recently that she consistently tops their exams, amidst her peers who, like me, finished from top universities. I can't help but feel that this only reinforces my own imposter syndrome. If my friend who went to the same unknown university as I did, performed as well as me, even getting the exact same honor and exact same score in the medical admission test I did, yet she's performing spectacularly in med school whereas I'm now below average, then it only means I really did just luck out on my achievements so far.

2884,"What's the psychology behind Imposter Syndrome?

If I were to reply that question based on my experience with imposter syndrome, I'll say it's because I expect people to acknowledge my capabilities the way I imagine I'd have done it to someone else. But how often do I compliment someone else irl? It's quite rare that I pat on a friend or a relative's back to celebrate their accomplishments. This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.

I feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions. This is why this sort of compliments feel diluted like it's not meaningful enough to digest as truthful.

However, in real life, I work as a software developer and whenever my boss or the seniors compliment me (which rarely happens) on something I did, suddenly all of that worries instantly go away but unfortunately, it's only temporary. I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.

A potential cure?

I think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us. For me, those people are my parents, my brother, my boss, the seniors at work and a couple of colleagues in my rank. I believe that if one wants their imposter syndrome to completely go away, they're gonna have to maximise the amount of compliments they want to generate from these meaningful people. The compliment may not be physically expressed but it could also be subtle as in an increase in the respect people have for you.

In order to please those people, you're gonna have to 'git gud' in life. Work on yourself constantly, keep improving yourself. Always be active. Always ask for something to do. Try to work on the bank of knowledge of your department if you work in software. During my spare time, not only do I browse Reddit but I have tabs of research materials open. I gather knowledge which my team will need in the future and I present them during meeting.

Work your way up the hierarchy of competence and you'll notice your imposter syndrome will slowly fade away. The way people will look at you will be different. They will smile at you. They will be happy to work with you and to me, that's the one effective way to combat against that horrible, horrible thing called imposter syndrome. Get GOOD!",trust

I am scared I will lose all 3 of my people when they realise they don't actually like me.

Have been friends with my online friend for a few years, & still EVERY SINGLE TIME we talk (most days) I am scared that this will be the conversation that kills our friendship, or that if I say something silly he will never speak to me again.

My husband has given up telling me why I am a likeable person or a good friend, when I am crying because someone said they like me, or called me their friend, or thanked me for always being there for them, or a customer at work said they like my hair that day, or whatever the reason.

I... Like to think I'm intelligent. I don't think I truly believe that. I like to think that I belong in grad school, that I got admitted for a reason. I passed my comprehensives exams and I didn't think I belong.  Facing my candidacy exam, lackluster results from simple experiments, anxiety, clumsiness, I've wanted to die. I guess I've found no meaning of my life outside of productivity.

Should I just leave? I'm not entirely sure what to do. I need the PhD to remain in the US or move to another country. Going home is not an option that bodes well. This keeps me going day in and day out. I love science I just think I'm fucking awful at it. I constantly think my labmates feel I'm a joke. I constantly think I'm a waste if space and it makes me tired. I'm not sure how to get out of my head. In any case, I'm trying to push through.

2905,"So I think I may have imposter syndrome and it literally driving me nuts.

I did poorly at school, not because I am unintelligent but because my home life was unpleasant and  I was bullied at school.

I now have a good job that pays a decent wage.

Here’s the problem ... it’s the way I got the job. 

The job is in an industry that I’ve been in my whole life but not in a field of the industry that I am that familiar with.

The company I worked for prior to this one went through some restructuring and my job role was included in that, I would’ve had to relocate.

Someone I used to work for has become a dear friend and let me know about a job in the company her husband works for, he is now my manager.

I applied, interviewed with him, interviewed with his boss and was offered the position.

I have been in the job just over a year now and feel like I don’t know what I am doing. We recently had a meeting with lots of colleagues and I felt out of my depth and panicked.

I felt like I didn’t have a good enough awareness of what is going on in my marketplace, I felt like I don’t know enough about my customers and competition.

I feel that sometimes my boss thinks I’m stupid and that he only employed me as I am friends with his wife.

My annual appraisal was good and I met or exceeded expectations but this was written by my boss with no consultation at all. We had no meeting to discuss or one since.

I reason with myself that it wasn’t just his call and his boss must have thought I was capable to do the job too.

But almost daily I am calling into question my capability to do this job.

-I’m embarrassed of my current employers’ website (I do content but I don’t have domain over the site)

-I feel like I’m not one of those public facing team members; I’m a little shy, but def knowledgeable and passionate. 

-I’m not a ‘cool, hip, slick, chic’ kinda girl so I don’t feel like Id fit into that world (this industry is like that)

I've been trying to get to my dream job for 10 years - becoming a creative director for an ad agency that deals with non-profits/govt. I'm pretty close currently - I'm a creative lead for an agency that does work for transportation clients, which can include the govt. I like the overall atmosphere but...

I've been here for 3 months now. The first big project I've had is a branding project for an organization's program. We presented concepts to the client and while they didn't completely freak out and call it OMGZ AMAZING, they were still really well received and they liked it. 

My supervisor doesn't feel it's enough. She wants them to basically freak out with joy when they see our work, because that's what they've done in the past. So much that, she got an OK from our CEO to hire an art director as a freelancer and she starts Monday. I feel pretty defeated/rejected/unworthy at this point - everything I've tried working for in this field just feels like it's been for nothing, and at this point I don't know what I'm doing being a creative anymore. I'm not good enough. 

The reason this hits me so hard is because overall I have had a hard time keeping a job for the same exact reason - I've never been enough for a company. I don't know what I can do anymore. I have never felt like I am good enough in this field, but it's the only thing I know. While my job doesn't get that I'm overloaded and don't have the bandwidth to think as strategically as they want me to, it just doesn't matter.

What they think, though, is that that'll translate to being able to freestyle dance or ballroom dance on a whim. The same goes for piano: some people can walk up to a piano with no plan and improvise a wonderful tune, while I spend a year learning two songs and can't improvise to save my life.

2. i feel like i shouldn't have friends because i'm always thinking about what i don't like about a person to make me distance myself from them, i'm always the afterthought friend, i always feel like i have to put up a front for each and every person for them to like me and i'm just lying to everybody. I also constantly feel like every nice act that someone does to me is fake. it's like in my head if: someone compliments me = they're being fake nice out of manners, someone does something nice for me = they're pitying me. this is even down to things like homework.
3. ever since i was a kid, my parents constantly compared me as inferior to my older sisters, so every single decision in my life that i made has been to distinguish myself from them. my grades are better, i got into a better university, i'm more ""obedient"" to my parents, etc yet i still get ""why aren't you as smart/responsible/organised/blahblahblah as your sister?"". To family and friends, my sisters are the ""successful one"", the ""smart one"" and i'm always, ""the one that's good at looking pretty"". I want to be recognised as intelligent and ambitious too. The other day my sister got her hair cut in the same haircut that i've been planning for two years (she didn't know, so it isn't her fault) and i got so upset about being compared to her if i did cut my hair like that (we look really similar), that i impulse cut my hair a really different hairstyle.
4. i feel like everything i do isn't enough. when i got accepted to college, the first things my mother asked me were ""on what grounds?"" ""can they take it back"" and then ""where is (name of my friend she really likes) going? medicine? omg i'm so proud of her!"" and every time my college topic comes up, she only talks about my friend and how amazing she is. my mother hasn't talked to me about college once. today, while we were taking about a trip that i'll take alone to my hometown, i told her my sister and her boyfriend would pick me up from the airport, and she said to me, ""nobody cares enough to go that far for you.""

2925,"So I've read about imposter syndrome somewhere last year and felt as if it described me. However, I also felt as if I was lying about my thoughts and feeling about this, as if they were not as valid as those of another person. 

I've had some things happen to me in my life, bad stuff, that have left a mark on me. But everytime I want to talk about it to someone or feel sad about it, my thoughts are telling me that ""there are people who have it worse than me"" or that ""my problems aren't really that bad"", ""I'm only trying to get attention"" and things like that. So I end up holding all my feelings and sadness inside because I feel like no one will take me seriously.   
I feel as if I will only be valid after something REALLY bad has happened to me idk... Everytime I go through bad stuff, I convince myself it wasn't actually that bad and if I dare to complain about it, I am only hurting people who actually went through bad stuff so I'd better shut up.  
e.g. I had a boyfriend once who hit me twice and held a loaded gun to my head 'jokingly', he manipulated me into doing stuff for him I didn't want to do, even sexually. However, this relationship only lasted between 3 - 4 months. So I tell myself it was only a short amount of time, there are people in similar of even worse situations for years so just shut up about your little problem because you are hurting these people. Idk, is this normal?? 

I also feel like I'm a fake with doing things I like. Like photography, my studies (applied psychology), writing... I never own these things like other people do. I tell myself I am actually not good at any of this stuff so I end up not practising enough to actually get better. Or when people give me compliments on something I did, I tell them everything that went wrong, or how it is not as good as how person x did it, show them imperfections, talk about the help I got from others...

2928,"idk if this is the place for this.   like trying to get into a new thing, a new franchise.  actually, pretty much anything ive been a part of i often feel like im not a 'true fan'.   so for example, something old that i liked since i was a kid was pokemon.  i started out with the first games, RBY.    i dont really feel like an imposter for liking pokemon, but sometimes i still do.  but even moreso is something like street figther.  i never played traditional fighting games until a few years ago, with Street Fighter V.   i really want to like it, but i feel like such idk, an outsider? a fake? both.   i wasnt a part of the community that followed the games from the originals.   i like the storyline, the lore, but since i wasnt a part of it from the beginning, i feel detached from it somehow.  like its not a part of me and never will be.  whereas pokemon, its practically part of my identity (maybe thats a bad thing too, basing myself off of external things, trying to see myself in characters and not seeing the characters as separate entities from myself, but i have always struggled with knowing myself in general).     


but its just especially prevalent with new things. i cant get into things easily.  i constantly think about the people who know more, have been around longer, are better at the videogames, what have you.   makes me feel like trying to find ""my"" thing, but i dont have a thing.   ""jack of all trades, master of none, better than a master of one"", but that doesnt feel true. i wish i was really good at one thing.  i feel im straying from my original issue, but well, its that i cant commit to anything.  my passions are flimsy, i never feel completely immersed in anything--instrument, music, movies, drawing, videogames, skilltoys; i do all these different things but i never completely can give myself permission to just enjoy something fully.  i always feel sortof detached no matter what i do--and that also prevents me from really excelling at anything, i think.     


but it also feels like a depression thing.  it feels sorta cyclical; cant get immersed-->dont feel enjoyment-->cant get immersed.  which came first, idk, but the result is me being more or less numb.    and t his extends to so much beyond just liking things. its like part of who and how i am.   like afraid to be real.  so afraid that i forget how to stop being afraid, and when i start to mellow out, i get anxious becuse suddenly there's a weight to everything.  to social interactions. to the real world.  and then i go numb again, because its safer to have this hyper-aware, low level anxiety combined with a detachment from personal feelings, than to actually feel.   but feeling is what makes life worth living, obviously.   gotta take the good with the bad, or neither and end up with nothing.  but the bad psyches me out to the point of giving up on anything i started to be passionate about--thus cyclical.  its like my choices are: feel too much, or feel nothing.  yeah this is definitely beyond just imposter syndrome, but it also feels like it isnt. like its a part of imposter syndrome.

Think about it. For the other imposter types listed, even if internally they feel like a mess, there are still some external benefits to their internal insecurity.

1. The perfectionist will still strive for that 100%. Even if they do miss that 1%, they are still going to probably be 99% better than most people.
2. The superwoman/man will work harder than anyone else. Even if they are insecure, their efforts show up in their work and gain them respect.
3. The expert gathers every piece of information and knowledge that they can. Even if their knowledge is incomplete, they still know more than probably the average person.

But the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist""? Lord help them. And by Lord help them, I mean Lord help me LMAO.

1. The soloist is fighting a losing battle. They are trying to go it alone WHILE also trying to be perfect. We all need mentors and teachers to help us to learn things! People will think that you are arrogant because you are trying to learn things on your own. And you most likely will also fail because who can succeed without the help of others?
2. And the ""natural genius""? Oh my goodness, this is even worse! Think about it: this person (me, lmao) delusionally thinks that they can excel WHILE on minimal effort AND on their first try. They give up easily at the sign of any challenge, because that's a sign that they aren't ""good"" or ""talented"" or ""smart"" enough. Therefore, they never actually excel at anything.

I feel like the first three (perfectionist, superwomen/man, expert) are almost like ""productive"" imposters. People that feel like imposters, but at least do something about it that can somewhat productively counteract those feelings.

But the bottom two, which I unfortunately am? It's like where you feel like you are an imposter, and instead of at the very least compensating for it, you just try to hide it... by trying to go it alone so that no one can see your imperfections at least for a short while (soloist) or by only ever sticking to things that are ""easy"" so that you can pretend like you are some sort of ""natural genius"" of some sort.

It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter.

Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon.  My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack.

I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me.  ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ <--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it.  I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

&#x200B;

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself.  But I am definitely in crisis.  The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline.  The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it.  I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me.  I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me.  That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

&#x200B;

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work.  I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth.  I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents).  I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is.  He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere.  I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me.  So I try to make him as happy as possible.  He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

&#x200B;

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life.  And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have.  In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can.  I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON.  Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine.  But I lie.  My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason.  I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day.  I ignore them.  One of these bills is for $8.  Eight fucking dollars.  I'm paralyzed about it.  I won't fix it.  These are only a few aspects of my life as examples.  I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships.  I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having.  I lie about having other plans.  I deserve to have my life fucked up.  I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway.  At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it...  It feels like my whole world is upside down.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, thank you.  I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this.  The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

&#x200B;

This is the first day of my life.  Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where.  I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing.  I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

2936,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn’t put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn’t. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family’s and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if’s. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it’s why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I’ve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what’s looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don’t look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it’s offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don’t have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We’ll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don’t feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don’t treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven’t earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn’t earn it, that’s bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that’s where you go so ride it out. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don’t go down the dark hole there’s nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.


If you suffer badly from this i suggest reading the book, “ The Alchemist”

God luck guys!

I have been to the depths of imposter hell and crawled my way back up over years and now wear those scars like a badge of Fucking honor. If anybody of you need somebody to chat with or help feel Free to reach out I’d love to keep rock bottom at a very low vacancy as it’s not somewhere you want to go.

2937,"This was originally posted in [r/confidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence) and r/Anxiety but it's obviously hugely relevant to this subreddit:

Hi all,

I (27F) have always had ups and downs with anxiety, confidence and insecurity. I'm going through a rather difficult patch at the moment. I'm a journalist and I've just started a new job. I used to work on long form documentaries but making the switch back to daily news is really daunting.

I went through a very competitive interview process to get here, and I've always received very positive feedback on my work in every other job. So logically, I should feel like getting this job is really well-deserved.

However, the other members of the team are extremely good - intimidatingly so. There are many people here with a lot more experience than me (even the more junior members of the team) who seem to be far fuller of ideas than I am and much more vocal. They approach their work with a confidence and conviction that I can never see myself having.

I am much shyer than my coworkers and struggle to speak up in meetings. I have been trying to force myself to do this more, and even recently spoke at a public event to try and gain more confidence. It hasn't got any easier at all, and I still cringe when I hear myself speaking in front of a large group. I don't feel like my ideas are as original, creative, fully formed and well-thought out as the ones many others pitch. I spend hours researching topics I'm interested in, but I struggle to form proper stories out of my ideas and therefore don't pitch very often. I know I should arrange a meeting with my boss to talk about these issues, but I feel like they are always so busy and I don't want them to think they've made a mistake by hiring me if I highlight my insecurities.

Because I'm so intimidated by my coworkers, I feel reluctant to start conversations or even make small talk with them, even though I know I would benefit from doing this and learn a lot from them. I know it actually looks worse that I'm not taking the time to engage with them, but the thought of doing so makes me anxious.

I just feel like a great big fraud, really. I want to become a really good journalist, but I know this anxiety and lack of self-esteem is really holding me back.

Does anyone else here have similar experiences at work? Any tips that might help?

TL;DR: I'm struggling with imposter syndrome at work and it's affecting my ability to do my job and form relationships with my team. Any advice or details of similar experiences much appreciated!",fear

The problem is that I have realized how little I actually know and how often it causes me to fuck up at work. I feel like every other day my manager is confronting me about yet another mistake. 

It kind of came to a head on Monday when I not only screwed up a 2 week project, but I mishandled a piece of Very Expensive machinery. My boss told me that people have been fired for a similar mistake and next time I WILL lose my job. 

I have an advanced degree but I feel like an absolute bonehead. I know we all make mistakes, but I honestly I don't know why I haven't been fired yet. I also have anxiety which doesn't help... but man it feels like I'm not cut out for this.

Ever since I was little, I was taught that I was not as sick as I felt and just talking myself into it/faking it. The reasoning behind this was that I should learn to go to school no matter what because when you are a working adult you can't always be sick either. I also had a friend who was anxious about getting sick and dying because of every little discomfort (hypochondriac) and it made me scared that I could have the same disorder instead of being actually sick.

One moment I feel like this thinking has had a major impact on my physical health because I didnt take symptoms seriously, then I feel like an imposter who only feels sorry for themselves. Every time I have any symptoms I feel like a pussy and I had to learn the hard way that I have to take breaks for my immune system, I now have severe asthma with biweekly attacks.

I have imposter syndrome from my relationship. 

To start of, I have an amazing boyfriend, who is really good at a lot of computer related things. I'm proud of him, but sometimes it gets to me.

He always mentions starting new projects and gets really excited, when he shares his thoughts an ideas. I like listening to him and helping out with ideas, but latley it's been really hard to accept myself.
We both take interest in the same area, but I don't have as much experience as him. That leads me to feeling terrible about myself and my work. I try to cancel out the thoughts I'm having, but they come back. It has gotten to the point where I have trouble feeling motivated. I find distractions, but only end up hating myself even more.

I did got all A's in my college algebra course, my chemistry course, and am currently doing very well in my biology class. BUT it's still at a community college so I know the material is dumbed down quite a bit. 

I just feel like I'm not good enough and that I don't belong to play with the ""big boys"". I mean I know the classes are hard for everyone but I'm scared and considering a different career. 

I've never been ""proud"" of myself, like ever. I feel like going through these notoriously hard courses (calc 1 & 2, physics, trig, bio with a 4 hour lab) I really will truly be happy. I feel like giving up will make my imposter syndrome worse BUT they are *realistically* very hard classes.

I got in with the lowest accepted GPA in my very small class. School was rough, but no exams were failed aside from one where I was pushed through for being 1/5th of a percentage point off from passing the class, and this was common in my program for profs to find extra half marks in their work for kids who were close to the next letter grade.

I know it sounds ridiculous… and again… if I say it “out loud” I usually feel better… and more in the realm of reality.
 I’m planning to keep trying and improving and do what I can- but DAMN. I have a huge bill to climb and sometimes I doubt my ability to climb it. I feel like I can’t talk about it (for various reasons) and I’m happy this sub exists so I can vent my frustrations safely… thanks guys.",trust

2979,"Hi everyone! I am new here. So, I was on a law students reddit page a while ago and came across the term Imposter Syndrome. I got curious and googled the term. After that, I searched and took Imposter Syndrome quizzes online (I know its not reliable but I just want to see how I fair) and turns out that every single one of the quizzes I took said I have a high tendency or possibility of having Imposter Syndrome.

Looking back, I think I identify with the signs of having it. I have been an achiever since I was a kid. I was a consistent Honors Student (Straight As) from Elementary to High School. In college, I did well too. I was consistent Deans List and graduated Cum Laude. I was Managing Editor of our College Newspaper and competed and won regional and national titles in Journalism competitions. 

Went to law school and did fairly well again. Took the bar only once and passed. I was a lawyer before I was 30. 

My whole life I was expected to accomplish high feats. People see me as an achiever. But to be honest, I dont see myself as such. I always think that I might be good but someone will always be better than me. I always think that I should have accomplished more rn at my age but i havent. I feel like all other friends, classmates I had have already come a long way.

I feel like whenever I make a mistake, people starts talkingbehind my back and talk/gossip abt me not being good at what I do. I feel like all the accolades and hardwork I did doesnt really make me capable. I dont like talking abt my achievements or being complimented coz I feel embarrassed. I just wanted to be lowkey. I remember passing the bar and when I was congratulated I said I was just lucky. 

I thought all these are just normal and a part of me being the introvert that I am. But when I came across the term ""Imposter Syndrome"" and read abt it felt like a glass shattered (like in HIMYM episode called ""Spoiler Alert"" lol) and it all kind of become clearer to me. I dont know who to talk to abt this so I looked for a group here on reddit hoping to get to discuss or maybe help me understand abt this more.

It absolutely nailed it for me in terms of highlighting a big assumption that people make about artists: that art is just a hobby or a pastime. Of course for some it is, but for thousands of artists it is their main occupation.

2981,"Hi, 
I’ve been feeling a sense that I don’t belong at my firm anymore for quite a while. I got a small promotion and more work given to me and it feels like I’ve fumbled my way thru it all. My senior management doesn’t inform me of mistakes I’ve made anymore and instead they they just fix themselves. My manager doesn’t really speak to me anymore besides I’m teams when something is needed. And recently a team member was let go for underperforming. 

My problem is that i think I’m in the same boat as the the coworker who recently was let go. I feel as tho I underperform even tho I work late almost everyday and soon I’ll be let go too. It takes me longer to do work which in accounting is how we charge the client. If I run up a budget we lose money and I worry about it all the time. I’m trying to to study for the cpa on top of keeping whatever work life balance I can and I just honestly can’t keep up anymore.

Need some advice on how to deal with this. Minor panic attacks have started so I definitely need some sort of help.

Thanks for any advice",trust
2982,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day. I'd been wanting to apply elsewhere for a while now and now is probably a good time, but I suddenly feel so humiliated and discouraged that I don't feel like I'd be good enough anywhere.",trust
2983,"I was diagnosed with imposter syndrome around 2 months ago. Something that helped me overcome it was self talk. Specifically the way instructed by Shad Helmstetter.

2984,"I really need to get this off my chest. I started a new role about 3 months ago. I became a Partner Manager coming from a Partner Marketing role in tech though my background is a Social Sciences degree.

When I told my former boss about the offer I had and about a potential raise with it he said “I don’t understand why would someone pay that much for you. But I guess it’s a testament that we’re so good our competitors want our people” . 
Ever since that comment I’ve had even more imposter syndrome. I feel like I never know enough, do enough or am good enough. 
I feel like I have way too much time for my tasks so it makes me feel like I’m always not doing something.
And on top of that people have been leaving the company + layoffs in tech and feel constantly stressed, anxious and starting to feel depressed.

2985,"I frequently get imposter syndrome not about my skills but actually about my interests. 

Almost every time I'm interested on something, say sports, music, reading, I get this weird feeling that I'm faking everything, which makes me feel bad when talking to other people about those interests and also while I'm focusing on them.

It's like I think I'm supposed to know everything about something if I'm interested in it. Otherwise I'm just posing.

Just to give an example, there's this rock band I love and some years ago I showed them to my mom and more recently showed her their new album. On the other day my mother told my about this oldie song from them which I didn't know. It is an awesome song, but at that very moment I started feeling like a poser, because if I don't know that song then I don't really know anything about the band and I don't really enjoy them, I'm just faking.

This pattern has happened with almost every interest I get. I love talking to people about my interests and teach things about them, but when the opposite happens I start feeling like I'm a fraud and I'm just pretending to be more interesting than I actually am.

2986,"I'm a woman in tech. I struggled with impostor syndrome for years. I can't say I overcame it completely, but I learned how to manage it and shut it up.   


This is how I do it: 

1. Recognize Imposter Syndrome - recognize when the ""monster"" is speaking to you to conquer it
2. Reach out for support - you're not alone, many people go through this
3. Keep reminders of past successes - build a bank of successes you can reference to snap out of it.
4. Practice positive self-talk - refer back to your past successes to be kind to yourself 
5. Manage your thoughts - we think 60,000 thoughts every day, some of those thoughts are trash and you don't have to believe them

My water broke. I didn’t fully believe it, thought I was just extra leaky. I start feeling contractions and think that I’m being DRAMATIC over some cramps. Finally get to the hospital, contractions kick up to the peak of pain and I’m thinking that again, I’m being dramatic. That there’s no way this is true labor and I’m gonna walk out still pregnant and a $15000 hospital bill for wasting their time.

2995,"Quick, who is your favorite author?

One of my favorite authors right now is Michael Wickett. He's an accomplished Nightingale-Conant motivational speaker and author. His book, ***It's All Within Your Reach*** is one of the best I've ever read.

I hold him in high regard because of that book.

Most, if not all of us, feel the same way when it comes to authors. Statistically speaking, about 80 percent of the American population wants to write a book, but so few embark on this journey. If I had to guess, I would probably say that many people do not believe they have what it takes to write a book, which, at the root is simply fear. But, I once heard Les Brown say, “When your why is big enough, you will find you how.”

I’m going to lay out 10 reasons why you should write a book and maybe, just maybe after you read them, you will find you how, and if not, I promise to help you.

## Reason #1: A book is an instant confidence booster

As I mentioned at the outset, how do you normally feel about authors? Do you treat them differently from the average person? What sort of impression do you get when you're introduced to an author?

When people perceive you in a high and elevated way, you begin to feel better about yourself. It’s an instant confidence booster. Most people treat authors as celebrities. And imagine if your book hits Amazon's #1 Best-Seller Status. What would that do to your confidence and self-esteem?

I know I felt great when mine hit that status. Not in a prideful or boastful way, but just proud of myself and what I’ve accomplished since the death of my mom. I know she would be proud of me as well.

## Reason #2: A book allows you to see your value and potential

Author John Maxwell said, “Many people fail to grow and reach their potential because of low self-esteem.”

When I was depressed and contemplating suicide, my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I could not see any value or worth in my life. But I was motivated by the thought of a postage stamp and so I began to add value to my life, first by exchanging my negative thinking for more positive ones, I began to exercise, eat healthier and start back fellowshipping with my congregation.

When I began to write, I learned to get out of my head and to see my real potential and value as a human being. If you don’t realize you have genuine value or that you're worth investing in, then you’ll never put in the time or effort required to grow.

One of my favorite motivational speakers Zig Ziglar said, “It’s impossible to consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with how we see ourselves. We can positively do very few things if we feel negative about ourselves.”

I know for a fact, that every aspect of our lives is directly impacted by the way we see ourselves. When you write and pour out your heart onto paper, you see how far you’ve gotten in life, and all that you've accomplished.

## Reason #3: Writing a book is an opportunity for self-reflection

Have you ever gone to therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. Going to therapy helped me cope with being sexually molested as a young girl. Well, I get that same type of help every time I sit down to write. Writing allows you to dig deep within yourself. You are alone and vulnerable and you're able to work things out on paper that you can’t do when they stay locked up in your head.

Writing forces you to reflect on your life. Most of the time, when we take the time to self-reflect, we see patterns that we need to change and habits we need to develop.

When I was in the fifth grade, my amazing teacher, Mrs. Battle brought a snake into the classroom and we had the privilege of seeing the snake shed its skin. It was the absolute most captivating thing I’d seen at that time. When I write, I also see myself shedding my old skin, my old thinking, and my old dishonoring ways for a newer, better version of me.

Writing has allowed me to change my life and the byproduct of that is I’ve changed the way I think about myself. I no longer see myself as a victim. I am strong and unbreakable. By the way, so are you.

Our lives are so hectic. Learning to pause allows growth to catch up to you.

## Reason #4: Writing a book allows you to flex your brain power

Did you know that our brains weigh about three pounds? It is such a small organ, yet it packs a punch. When you write, even when you're writing your own story, inevitably you will have to do some research, whether that be interviewing your family members or hopping onto Google to get some facts or now, AI ChatGPT.

Our brains are muscles. Just like any muscle it needs to be flexed or it will atrophy. Writing allows you to flex your brain. When you step outside of your comfort zone you give yourself a chance to explore new things about yourself. One new point discovered can lead to other points and you never know where that can take you. I’ve learned that to be a success, you first have to think it and the only way you start to think it is, either you change or something in your life forces you to change.

Nothing in life remains the same forever.

Writing helps you to determine your future. You can write your ticket in life or continually allow someone else to force you to write theirs. Stop thinking in terms of “Can I” and start thinking in terms of “How Can I.”

“How Can I” puts a different spin on things. It’s the beginning of a high-value question that prompts you to figure it out. Start asking the right questions and your brain will begin to give you better answers.

## Reason #5: A book is an ideal way to create side-hustle income

Most people that I come into contact with would love to someday work for themselves, whether it's for financial freedom or just because they want to spend more time at home with their family.

When you write a book and you get the title of #1 best-selling author attached to you, people are going to take notice.

Published authors are considered experts and authorities in their field. If you had a book, do you think you could send that book to a business prospect? How do you think you would be perceived by that person? Would it be difficult to land that contract? I don’t think so.

Writing a book positions you as an authority. This fact can help you sell more products and services which will ultimately impact your bottom line.

Would you like to earn more money just by writing a book?

That would be a yes for me too.

Just think, what if you were allowed to get paid for sharing with other people information you already know?

Now, perhaps unlike at any other time in history, if you possess knowledge that other people would be willing to pay for, you can start making money, with little or no startup costs, especially with the help of AI.

Teaching online grants you the freedom to still work a day job yet generate side-hustle income. Today, it’s a real possibility to even make just as much money while you're asleep as when you're awake, thanks to the power of the Internet and AI.

You have the opportunity to teach and share what you're most passionate about with large audiences. Would you like to share what you love and be paid for doing so?

So now are you beginning to see how finally earning what you’re worth by sharing your knowledge and expertise with others would help boost your self-confidence and self-esteem?

## Reason #6: A book will help you get over your fears, even your fear of public speaking

Have you ever noticed that authors are usually asked to speak at conferences or seminars? Well, my friend, the same will be true for you. I know, but you’re afraid of speaking, right?

Well, the only way to face any fear is to stand up to it. We overcome our fears by doing the thing that we fear. Here are three other ways to overcome fear:

* Define your fear. When we face new situations in life, we normally imagine the worst-case scenario. But, did you know that you can dramatically shrink your fears by simply putting them into words on a piece of paper? See how writing helps you to slay fear.
* Accept the challenges that fear presents to you. Instead of shrinking back and giving fear the upper hand, accept fear as a normal part and life and act despite it. A great tool from author and speaker Mel Robbins of The 5 Second Rule, really works. Try it. When you want to do something, just count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and then do the thing that you fear. Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Do one thing every day that scares you.”
* Think of the benefits of acting in the face of your fear. Think of what it will do for your self-esteem and self-confidence. A good exercise is to physically write down the benefits you will gain by forging ahead. The thing to remember is that every decision you make is helping to form the person you are becoming. Do you want your fear to define you or do you want to take that scary risk and come off the victor?

## Reason #7: A book will help you be more productive by raising your standards

Do you find that you are easily distracted and not being as productive as you can be? Well, writing a book during a challenge will not only help you with your productivity it will also help you with developing discipline, determination and just plain grit.

When you write a book, it’s just you, the blank slate, and now AI. Writing helps you remain singularly focused on the task at hand. It is an exercise in discipline and time management. If you stick to it, your determination will give way to a beautiful masterpiece. And no, it doesn’t have to take months anymore, it can take a weekend. I will show you how to write 10 books in 30 days.

Let me ask you a question, what's the difference between something you should do and something you absolutely must do?

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, “The things easy to do are also easy not to do.” In other words, the things you should do are things that are easy not to do and so you don’t do them. Some of these things are:

I should eat healthier.

I should exercise more.

I should treat my spouse with respect.

But when you absolutely must do something, as if your life depended on it, there is a shift and change in you. If eating healthier meant you would live or die, then you most likely would do it. The same with exercise and treating your spouse with respect, if your life depended on it, you would make the necessary changes.

When you raise your standards and turn “should” into “must,” you are making an inner shift to take control over the quality of your life. Any area in which you are not getting what you want is because you haven’t raised your standards.

According to Tony Robbins, “Most people, if they look at how they are living their lives today, will find that their identity is based on a set of standards and a set of beliefs they created 10, 20, 30 or more years ago. Many of us made decisions when we were kids about what to believe, what we are capable of, and who we are as a person, and that became the glass ceiling that controls us. But are you the same person you were back then? Are you the same person you were even a year ago?”

I’m just going to say it, you have to demand excellence from yourself. Don’t be mediocre. Be world-class. Don’t settle for the status quo, be relentless. Pursue excellence. “People are rewarded in public for what they’ve practiced for years in private,” said Tony Robbins. Never ever give up. Raise your standards. Writing will help.

## Reason #8: A book will help you develop bullet-proof habits

To complete your book, you have to have good habits, otherwise, you’ll never get it done.

In 2008, after my mom died of colon and liver cancer, a few years later, I developed the habit of getting up at 4 a.m. and going to the gym. That habit has helped and sustained me all these years. I knew I had to do something to get my mind out of the loop of negativity. I knew I had to physically move my body because where my focus goes, energy flows.

With that said, I started researching other high achievers and came across Brendon Burchard. Brendon has been studying high achievers for over 20 years and the biggest secret he has learned when it comes to habits is “trigger moments.”

In essence, trigger moments are cues that remind you to activate your intentions or habits.

I use my iPhone to create my trigger moments. A lot of people underutilize this great feature on their iPhones. Right now, I want you to take your “Clock” then hit “Alarm” and then add your alarm time. Then under “Label” write out your goal – the same one you have a picture of on your board. Press “Save”. Repeat this step three times for each of your goals. So from now on, every day at that time, you’ll be reminded to accomplish your goals. This is how you attack from all sides. You have the vision board, you have the alarm and now let’s move on to tip number three.

My all-time favorite bullet-proof habit device is pen and paper. When we track what we do, things get done. As an example, I started using my Apple Watch to track how many steps I take in a day. Before I had this device, I never walked 10,000 steps, but now that I track it, I make sure I do it every day. The same is true with any habit you form. When you write it down and track it, you will see the needle move, your results will encourage you to continue going. This helps to build momentum and you will become unstoppable. Writing has a funny way of doing that.

## Reason #9: A book helps boost your self-esteem and allows you to expect more out of life

Scientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But today, they’re learning more and more that we respond to what the brain expects to happen next.

Neuropsychologists call it the expectancy theory. Basically, through a lifetime’s worth of events, our brains learn what to expect next – even if it does not happen. And because our brain expects something will happen a certain way, we often achieve exactly what we anticipate.

Do you see the dilemma?

If you don’t expect much to happen in your life, then, most likely it won’t. But if you do expect something great to occur, it most likely will. The difference is that you have to believe it will happen to you.

But how do you get that belief?

Simply put, you need to build your confidence.

**Confidence is built through action.**

A great start is simply writing down on a piece of paper, what it is that you want and expect out of life. When you put into words what you are thinking in your head, it becomes real. You now have a way to make a plan and start seeing some forward movement in your life.

In a talk at TEDx San Francisco, Mel Robbins, self-help author of the book, The 5 Second Rule, mentioned that scientists estimate the probability of your being born at about one in 400 trillion.

Do you know what that means?

It means you are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal pride. You are extraordinary. There has never been anyone exactly like you in all history of mankind on the earth. You have amazing untapped talents and abilities that, when properly directed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want or dream of.

In essence, your very existence proves you are a miracle. So start acting like the miracle you are!

In a CD by Earl Nightingale, titled, The Strangest Secret, he says, “You become what you think about.” So what are you thinking? What are you constantly feeding your mind on? Your mistakes or your accomplishments?

Your thoughts trigger images and pictures and the emotions that go with them. These images then trigger your attitudes and actions. Therefore, if you think about success, you will feel strong and competent, but when you think about your mistakes, you will inevitably feel sad and weak.

We attract into our lives that which we think about. Whatever our dominant thoughts are, that is what will show up for us in our lives. To have more self-esteem you need to think the thoughts you would be thinking if you were already achieving your goal. Writing is a great place to start.

## Reason #10: A book helps you create and leave a legacy for your friends and loved ones

When my mom died, I wished she would’ve written a book, just a story about every aspect of her life that I failed to ask about. She was an extraordinary woman that I didn’t have enough time with. I do however have a few of her songs. She was an amazing songwriter, and that’s where I get my ability to write. Thanks, mom.

When we leave this earth, a few mementos and memories are all we have left of our loved ones. What if you had more? What if you had a book that detailed the lives of your mom, dad, grandparents and more? What if you left that to your children and relatives? How would they feel? How proud would they be? Could it perhaps encourage them to confidently go after their hopes and dreams?

I believe writing a book helps create your legacy. In our digital age, there's no telling who else will be touched and inspired by your thoughts and words. At the outset, I asked who was your favorite author or writer, what if they never wrote down that very thing that inspired you?

I believe we not only owe it to ourselves to write a book, but we owe it to the universe and the generations coming behind us. Do what author Steven Pressfield suggests in his book, The War of Art.

3001,"Sometimes it feels like my actions are geared, all of the time, to prove my imposter syndrome right. I applied for a job, genuinely believing I wouldn't receive an invitation to interview. I couldn't sleep the night I applied because I was humiliated at the thought of someone reading my C.V. To my surprise I got a call to interview. Shortly after that call, I told myself that they had already chosen another candidate for the job, and my invitation for interview was only because they had to fulfil a certain quota of interviewees. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well after that either.

Anyway, I performed poorly in my interview today and I didn't get the job. What do you know, my imposter syndrome was right all along. Running narratives like: it was silly of me to apply in the first place, why did I think I would've gotten this anyway, of course they had someone else in mind, I'm not skilled at interviewing so why would I even bother. I remember beforehand sitting in the interview waiting room thinking it's not too late for me to run away, cancel the interview, save the shame. 

What is this (imposter syndrome) about? Is it a perverse sense of self-preservation? Never fully committing to believing in myself, because the fall from grace would be too great? Feeling like I have to run harmful stories about myself, so that I can 'get in' before any threat enters? It doesn't work though. I still feel a bit upset despite 'expecting failure' - maybe because I realise that the way I treat myself is unfair, and ultimately doesn't get me anywhere.

Still, things I'm proud of (because fuck you imposter syndrome):

* I proved I can get to interview stage, gap in C.V. be damned 
* I can get through an interview, maybe not \*successfully\*. But the world didn't end. I'm alive. I'm here. The embarrassment of trying (& trying & failing & trying) won't kill me.
* I have accomplishments that speak for themselves and experiences to back it up. This is actually the objective truth and imposter syndrome can't take that away.
* I'm still breathing. And I'll try again and continue on with as open a mind as I can muster.",sadness

Right after this doctoral exam I got some very uplifting feedback from one of the professors saying that I impressed him with being able to answer all of his questions - and it felt like for the first time in my life, I had overcome my imposter syndrome. But, I had a job interview yesterday at my dream workplace and I've been crying for hours since. The head of r&d was there together with two section managers, one of them had interviewed me three months ago and initiated this second interview. He warned me on the phone that the head of r&d was going to put me under a lot of pressure with his questions to test me, and that I should not be intimidated by it. During the interview, he asked me so many questions within my field of research, and I just couldn't answer them, because I am embarassingly bad at remembering formulas. I regularly look them up because I simply can't remember even the basic stuff. Stuff like, what is mechanical power? And he could find all my weak spots and was so arrogant, sadistic even, and now I am questioning myself, how did I even end up getting a doctorate in engineering? And the other two interviewing me were so nice, they never would have tested me this way but now they heard how I can't answer high school level physics questions. I am not sure how I can confidently resume my work in engineering without feeling like everyone knows I'm a fraud. I worked so hard but always felt like trying to hide that I actually only know just enough to not get exposed.

**Identify and challenge your limiting beliefs.** While they have many guises, most limiting beliefs can be distilled down to two essential beliefs: I’m not good enough & I’m not worthy. We may also carry over beliefs from our early years which served us well then but now hinder us as adults.

**Recognize – and celebrate - your small victories.** Whatever small victories are meaningful to you. Within the context of having strategic plans, each small step is a victory in itself and also a step towards something so much bigger.

**Take responsibility for your current situation.** When you take responsibility, you take control. And when are in control, you have options and choices.

**Do something for others.** Creating meaning for yourself and value for others helps build your win / win relationship with the world around you.

**Take a step each day toward your ideal self.** We all have the same 168 hours each week – that’s just physics – the issue is what we choose to do with them. Adopting the habit of frequently asking yourself: what would be the most valuable thing I can do right now that would be a step in the right direction?

**Manage your self-talk.** We all talk to ourselves – it’s just how our brains work. When we choose to take control of our internal dialogue, we can make it work for us.

**Focus on the value adding activities.** When we think about what we have on our plate, considering how important and how urgent each item is really puts things in perspective. When we focus our efforts on what is important – in the context of what we have chosen to achieve – we’re moving in the right direction.

**Avoid comparing yourself to others.** This points to the difference between self-esteem (externally focused) and self-worth (internally focused). The only valid comparison is our previous self.

**A healthy self-image is central to our wellbeing. By adopting these habits, we can help ourselves to keep moving in the right direction.**",trust

I am not a poor learner or stupid by any means but I was never able to get even average grades. A lot of which had to do with the nature of my dad’s job. We moved around a lot, including abroad where I lacked proper schooling.

11 and 12 grade are super important in our country because they decide the university you will get in. I was so badly prepared for 11 that I decided to repeat. And when I repeated I failed. I had zero hope of getting anywhere.

But still I applied to every university possible. I knew that would only get into shitty ones. But by an absolute stroke of luck I got into a very good university (top 5 or something). I had an excellent entrance test score somehow and I forgot my result card so they just assumed I passed 11th grade (which I later did but not at the time). Very lucky.

University life was super tough for me. I had to study twice as hard as other to get half the results others were getting. I was so very close to failing multiple courses every semester but somehow I always managed to pass by slimiest of margins. My GPA was only 2.58/4 (that too thanks to COVID) but I graduated in 4 years. Very lucky again.

I started applying for jobs before my last semester even began. I was starting to see how my low GPA was holding me back. Everyone who started applying after me got the jobs they wanted. I was left behind. Felt extremely bad but I kept looking. 

My cousin referred me to a Big 4 firm. They don’t hire from our university, they only hire CPA or ACCA and i was just a Bsc student. The hiring process is also very tough. Tests and interviews. I gave my best and somehow I cleared it all. Turns out they were very short staffed so they made an exception for me. Very lucky again.

Its been 3 months and the job is going fine. But I do feel dumb compared to others as their knowledge is way more then me. I still do my best, I always pretend that I know shit when in reality I don’t. I constantly live in this fear that one day I will be exposed and it will all come crumbling down. They will know I just got into university by luck, i got into the firm by luck. In reality I don’t have the credentials for this job. I failed 5th grade, I failed 11th twice, i hardly passed university.

On the other hand many people who know me believe that i got into university and the firm because my father is somewhat influential. That is absolutely not the case. He dint even know I applied to these place till I got in.

He reminded the listeners that even successful people, like Usain Bolt, once stepped into a track for the first time. We don't grow if we don't live beyond what we know we're capable of.

For context, I’m 26, from the UK. A few years ago I completed an undergraduate degree in Physics, then recently my PhD. For the last 10 months I’ve been working as a Data Analyst - I passed my probation with no problems and I’m doing well at it.

Despite all of this, I still convince myself every day that I know barely anything; that everyone else is so much better than me, and that I’m just no good. I’m also scared to apply for higher paying roles because I’m worried I’ve found my limit, and that if I got another role I’d fail my probation or something.

I also have concerns about my memory. I’ve learnt so much stuff over the years and now I just feel like I’m forgetting so much, and just that I’m so much more forgetful and distant than previously. I sometimes struggle to pay attention in simple conversations with family and friends because my mind is elsewhere trying to see if I can remember (almost testing myself) stuff to prove I’ve not forgotten something. Maybe it’s just part of getting older, I don’t know…

I know this is probably all just imposter syndrome because nobody has ever raised any concerns about my ability or conduct. And, that the reason I’m probably forgetting more things is because I’m still learning other new things.

Any advice?",trust

I'm always trying to remind my coworkers to be mindful when they say mean things and I feel like a hypocrite when I do because who am I to correct them even though I make a conscious effort to be mindful. They've told me I can't change the world on my own but they also told me that I don't talk trash which is encouraging. When I'm with my friends I feel like I'm with people who share the same spirituality but I feel like a fraud. I feel like I don't belong no matter where I go. 

When I'm with my boyfriend and I tell him that I love him sometimes it's hard to look him in the eye because I feel like he won't believe me. I can't keep my hands off of him which worries me more that he'll think it's lust when I just love him a lot and I feel a transfer of that energy when I touch him. 

It is the most confusing thing to be so sure about my connection with someone and the solidity of the relationship but to also second guess it knowing that there is no reason to. Having had a toxic relationship in the past where my tunnel vision was so strong that I glorified every flaw and let him warp my being, it's difficult not to worry I'm doing the same thing sometimes but I know I'm not but back then I would've thought the same so how can I ever know.

It took several discussions with my wife to finally drill down to the reasons. First, my parents taught me perfectionism and that either you're a winner or loser.

Next, the field of cyber security is one of immense talent, and it's honestly becoming very hard not to compare myself with my coworkers.

And now I'm stressing about my performance evaluations... So why did I choose this job, well it's because I want to be seen as ""the expert"", so I choose difficult jobs that force me to learn.

Naturally, during PhD impostor syndrome was there at all times. Main ""reasoning"" why I'm going to be fired were common ADHD symptoms: forgetting, chaos, lack of planning skills etc. I covered it all by working much more than my peers, hence I felt I don't belong since others didn't have to work that hard to be there.

*edit: the ‘highest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it’s one of the reasons why I don’t belong there

—-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I’ve been more insecure than ever lately & I’m having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‘ranked’ #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don’t always say everything - but let’s just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it’s because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‘honors/cum laude’ grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I’m not trying to say I’m absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I’m not actually super talented, I’m just good at ‘taking exams’ + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I’m neurodivergent and am quite ‘slow’ in understanding things (even if it’s something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren’t so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‘grade’ I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I’m a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

On paper life is great. Earlier this year I came up with an idea with some friends and we build this company which we promptly sold (finalising last week). At the same time, ive met a woman of my dreams. Loving, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.   


Last week, I got paid for selling the company. I now have more money than I know what to do with and the love of a beautiful woman. Everything should be great right?   


When I got paid out last Friday I started having panic attacks and questioning my happiness. Not so much if I deserve it but coming to terms that, somehow, for reasons I cant really put my finger on I am not happy. I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in my life at a fairly early age but it has caused me to realise that I didnt even know what I truly wanted.   


I started withdrawing into myself in regards to my relationship almost immediately. Questioning my feelings and thoughts for this person who is changing my life for the better on a daily basis.   


I asked her for some space to try and figure this out and it backfired. Badly. To the point where she is saying I need to figure things out before I can ""have others in my life"".   


I now dont know what to make of it all. I am coming to terms with my new life but after working so hard for so long and going nowhere and being alone for so long only to have achieved all this ""success"" in both my personal and professional life so quickly has left me confused, anxious and extremely emotional.

3057,"I’m kinda realizing a glaring issue I have that tremendously hinders my time management and my school/life balance in general  

I’m a graphic design major. The first step in every project (or, like, project extension) is research. We research subject matter, connecting themes and concepts, color pallets, design styles, font choices and parings, design techniques etc. It’s an important part of our process, and then comes sketches and executing our chosen concept. (This all will be relevant in a min)

I’m in a super competitive design program. Two portfolio review processes not before, but after semesters of design classes. Only 40 of the 400 end up making it. 
It was hell, but it’s my senior year and I’m almost finished. I used to really like graphic design, I was passionate about it. I worked my ass off to make it through the portfolio reviews.  I think I placed my whole identity and self worth in my ‘dream career’. I had so many anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns during the portfolio review portion of this degree (the first 2 years). Now I don’t have to worry about passing the review, but I think i was mentally in fight or flight mode for so long that my brain is still recovering and something isn’t quite right. 

Despite making it through both reviews, My confidence is shattered. I second guess every decision I make. Everyone around me is so talented and I feel like a fraud. I’ve worked really hard to get here, but I’m so burnt out I can barley function. I have pretty strong negative associations with school, class, my work, and myself. 


Every single night, we have assignments and things we need to present in the next class. And every single night, the same cycle repeats.

I research, research, research. I spend hours stuck gathering inspiration, jotting down concepts, all because I’m afraid of moving onto the next step. I don’t eat meals, I don’t spend time with friends, and I’m not even doing any of the ‘real’ work until my internal clock kicks in maybe around 3 AM or in the morning before class. It’s always rushed together and I’m never proud of it. Because I’m never proud of my work, doing homework the next day becomes even harder. My brain does NOT want to move past the research step. Ever. I never feel ready. I loop myself into a constant cycle of spending WAY to much time on a meaningless first step, neglecting the important work, and feeling shitty about myself. I’ll be on my laptop after hours of throwing together pages and pages of mood boards I will hardly use, still doing the same thing and mentally screaming at myself to stop and I can’t. I never do, until the very last minute where I’ll have no other choice to.
I am self aware that this isn’t helping me, and yet every time in the moment I’ll still subconsciously justify it by convincing myself ‘at least I’m being productive rn, I’ll move on to the next step soon."" (It’s never soon) Im so upset at myself because I know if I could actually manage my time I’d have have the time to get everything done that I need to and still enjoy things like spending time with people, making meals, getting enough sleep, etc. I have the time to make quality work, too. It’s like I don’t let myself do any of that. 

I’ve pulled 5 all-nighters in the first 4 weeks. I’ve already missed 3 classes and been 30 min late to 2. Again, I don’t hang out with friends, I hardly ever eat full meals, i don’t go to parties or bars or play video games or any of that. It feels like this is all I do and my work is never good and I’m just making myself miserable. I’m so upset at myself and I deeply regret the hours and hours I waste on a daily basis.

My entire college experience has been like this, except at some point I was actually motivated by a love for graphic design. At this point I just want it to be over. I’m so tired, I feel defeated.

At work I have managed to be relatively successful, but all my career I have had a background minimum, and then full anxiety while I’m in a meeting or working on a project that I somehow scammed my way here and I’m waiting for someone to call me out. My peers and boss have told me that I just lack confidence, but I feel as if it’s deeper. I have learned over the years to just beat back the feeling or how to stay quiet and nod kind of thing. I try self actualization and try and boost myself all the time. I try to brush it off thinking that it doesn’t matter. 

My personal life I worry that my friends just put up with me. I worry that I’m just a bother to people. I worry I’m weird. They tell me I’m a great guy, and that I’m fun. Just like my work I try all the tricks and they work to a point. But my mind never stops. I can only escape in media. A book, a movie, tv, games, etc. anything to forget myself. 

My wife. God I love her. I would do anything for her. But I worry she married me because I was the safe bet, or because I made good money. Nothing nefarious mind you, but again I worry the next thing I say she might laugh or even get mad at me. She has never been that way towards me, it still it’s there…

I dunno do I fit the imposter syndrome label. Somehow I’m sure I need to see a doctor about this. I do have internalized manic episodes of happiness, anger, sadness, and depression. They come and go. None of these manifest themselves as physical other than my attitude. And my wife and put her finger in it every time that something is wrong, but I play it off as trivial, which generally it is I suppose, but I worry. 

Heh here I am wondering if I’m trying being an imposter here…

I was able to apply to a job in a very ideal education setting, in a position I never had the chance at acquiring before graduation, and was asked to an interview. I am qualified. I can’t wrap my head around that. I’ve felt severe anxiety since accepting the interview invitation. Not excitement or aspiration. I have no control over this emotion (or lack thereof). I cannot mentally accept I’ve accomplished this goal. 

My degree was conferred last month, but my *physical* diploma came in the mail today. Rather than feeling excitement, I cried. They weren’t tears of joy. 

I don’t believe in myself. It isn’t lack of confidence, because I will fill your ear with information on child development and the knowledge I’ve gained - it’s the reality that I’ve gained the degree, I’ve broken a generational cycle, I’v given myself the opportunity to work in a field I love, forever… and am going to continue this education to make the biggest impact on childrens’ lives that I am able. 

I’m excited for that. I am proud of that.

But it still seems like a distant dream I’ll never actually accomplish and I’m faking my way through being a professional.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I’ve done good. I’ve made mistakes, gotten subpar marks like everyone else but I was almost always able to pull it together when it mattered - GCSEs, A Levels, uni exams and assignments. This last year, the last year of my Bachelor’s, I seemed to be on track for a First, with me pulling myself through assignments with First-class marks.

And then I didn’t do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master’s program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It’s always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

3090,"Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this forum. I basically wanted to vent some stuff I've had on my mind the past weekend. So, I graduated recently with my bachelor's in statistics in early May, and I have been job hunting since then until literally a few days ago. I managed to finally get what I would have considered my ""dream job"", a data analyst position at a big company with great benefits and a fantastic starting salary. I truly couldn't believe it when I got the call back that I had finally gotten the job offer after having interviewed countless times and even being rejected once from another company I really wanted to work with.

Now, I struggle with incredibly low self-esteem in general. Although I graduated with the top of my class and had a near 4.0 grade point average, I still considered myself less than adequate for one reason: I had very little relevant work experience. I knew some programming languages sure as was required by my school coursework, but because I was a commuter student I wasn't involved in any fancy professional clubs/orgs, I had no internships in the field to speak of, and when I originally graduated, I was terrified I'd end up in a terrible job I didn't want doing something I was going to be bad at because all I really know how to do was study hard, learn really hard math, and get good grades.

I was and still am shocked as hell I managed to actually get my foot in the door as an official business analyst doing what I had originally went to college to do. But I feel like that initial anxiety I had still hasn't gone away. Now, I'm worried about basically ""fucking it up"". I didn't lie to them about knowing technologies I didn't know, it was obvious from my resume and the stories I chose to tell to them during my interviews that I had no internship experience and was basically a brand new freshie.

I basically just tried to convince them that I knew how to analyze datasets and math and could communicate difficult concepts to people. Which, honestly, I believe I can do. But at the same time, I'm not an expert by any means in any of the softwares I have used. In college, when given the choice to do something with software or by hand, I almost always did it by hand because I just preferred that, and I learned better doing that.

So I guess basically I'm wondering if what I'm going through is the dreaded imposter syndrome I've always heard about in fields such as these. I always felt deep down that I wasn't good enough, and I was shocked anyone decided to give me a chance at all. Part of me wants to tell myself that if they thought I wasn't going to be able to do the job, they wouldn't have hired me. I was a first-generation college student, no one has ever done a job like I'm doing in my family, and I literally have no frame of reference. I feel like I'm in undiscovered territory, and I have no idea what my first day is going to be like and what my manager is going to expect from me for the first few weeks.

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.  And my mentor made this long apology about how he should be doing better by me if I feel like a failure, that he loves working with me, etc.

I remember him saying, “I’m surprised your waist is that skinny.” “Your ankles are kind of fat.” It was like a load of bricks hit me. Why say that? Why point that out? He was no supermodel and of course I wasn’t scrutinizing his appearance. I just wanted a loving relationship. Fast fast forward. The scrutiny turned into much more. Making fun of me in front of his friends for laughs, hitting in my friends, being angry at me for not indulging him in a threesome, saying it was unfair and that I was effecting his life in an unfair way by withholding. Telling my I was stupid. I was back in college. I graduated with honors and kids in tow. Everything I did I now found myself checking three times to be sure.

So I started a new job about 7 weeks ago, it is a complete change of scenery and a male dominated industry but I do enjoy it.
My ex helped me with getting an interview as he knew the SSM who hires the employees.
I still went through the application and interview process but it was definitely more lenient for me.
And although I feel like I have proved myself capable and that I want to pursue a higher career in this industry, I still can’t help but think because I had help that I do not deserve it.

I have also found out my colleagues have sent a recommendation email to the SSM about me, which helps.
But the doubt is always there, plus my ex has now started using it against me in certain situations.

Curious as to how others deal with this or if it’s just a time thing waiting to feel like I’m apart of the company because I deserve to be not because I had a helping hand at the start.",anticipation

The thing is, I am not even a proper imposter. I'm more like a proper loser. I failed at everything in a specific activity, to which I dedicated 10 years of my life.

Anyone that knows anything about this can see that I miserably failed. Anyone else thinks that I'm a genius, but that's just because they don't understand the field.

So basically, I know I'm a loser on the field, and an impostor to outsiders. The double treat.

3108,"Okay so,  the title says it all basically.  I have struggled with IS for years, and generally end up internalizing it.  Mostly due to syndrome making me believe that I am just a whiny baby, not someone with an actual problem worth taking up time, money, and resources to fix.  

This internalizing has lead to countless occasions of hurting the people closest to me because of viewing the world from my skewed perspective as well as sabotaging myself and having to start over in life constantly.

So when the old feeling starting creeping up that I’m not a productive contributor to any facet of life I am in, I decided to speak up for once. I have bosses who are very understanding, a wife who is a saint, and a 4 year old daughter whose pictures I have everywhere and on me at all times, just in case I need a reminder why it’s worth it to keep fighting.  With all this, I can’t afford to “start over”, and thought maybe talking to some of these people I genuinely trust would help me achieve a different outcome this time.

The problem with this is of course, being the good people they are, they were understanding.  Or seemed understanding. But the reality that all of US know too well is they are only handling me with kid gloves because they think I’m a messed up loser who can’t handle reality.

No matter what I do I still feel like a failure and I can hardly even bring myself to do homework anymore. I get home and all I want to do is lay in bed, even watching tv takes too much out of me. Im slipping and im not being productive anymore and it’s only a matter of time before this all comes crashing down around me and im a complete and utter failure. It’s a vicious cycle because I’m so stressed about being a failure that I’m doing less because of it cuz I’m paralyzed. I avoid mirrors because I can’t even stand to look at myself anymore, and  I find myself having some pretty scary thoughts that I haven’t had since I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt about a year and a half ago.

3111,"Hi community. My first post in this community and I am curious about how Imposter Syndrome shows not only in your life but also specifically in relationships. 

About me: I am 37, almost 38, first and foremost a musician who has struggled with performance anxiety and always trying to give my best but then always end up thinking it wasn’t good enough, or that there’s someone better than me. Add in having parents who constantly asked why I wasn’t doing well in college and subsequently thinking they are always judging my every move in life. 

But I think most notably I struggle with my Imposter Syndrome surfacing in my relationships. I am gay and have had a couple significant relationships in my life, my last one being 7 years with someone who I viewed as more successful than me, smarter, etc. I am now entering a new relationship with a very creative person (who has admitted his own struggles with Imposter) but who has that ability to be confident, and show his self so strongly. As this relationship is going I find myself thinking thoughts that tear down every facet of hope in this relationship. And I am madly and deeply in love more and more every day.  Like, “what does this guy want with you, you don’t talk strong like he does, you don’t have strong opinions, you’re not good enough for him, if he really gets to know you he won’t like you, one day he will meet someone else that is better than you” 

I guess I’m looking for ways to cope, to live with this because I don’t think it will ever go away, to survive, to keep going, to love and be free to accept love. Thanks for listening.",trust
3112,"I just finished my second semester of online grad school for counseling and it was ROUGH. I took Counseling Techniques this semester and we do recording assignments to show our proficiency of skills. I did okay throughout the semester, but on the last assignment, I tanked. The Professor said that the assignment I submitted does not show the required level of competency in these skills. I have a passing grade in the class, but I wouldn't be surprised if I am still forced to retake it. 

I feel upset and stupid. I've had these feelings pop up throughout my two semesters. Also, in other classes, where I felt like I didn't belong. I want this career. I want to be a therapist, but maybe I do not have what it takes to be one. There are some things that you can learn and change within yourself and there are some things that you just can't. I'm not sure if this is something that I can change. 

Like the title says, I'm not sure if this is imposter Syndrome from seeing a reflection of my fear of failing, or a wake-up call that I'm not meant or cut out for this work. I even considered other possible career options in different directions. 

At this point, I am frustrated, upset, and concerned about my future. I also feel stupid if I ended up wasting my time and money not only in this grad school but also in my undergrad. I love psychology and will advocate for mental health always, but I'm starting to think that that is not enough. That loving the subject and dreaming about a career in that field is not enough. I'm starting to think that I chose the wrong career path and now I am stuck. I'm starting to wish for a redo on life to make sure that I pick right this time.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone.

People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

Update: I handed it in last week!! The only thought that kept me going was ""It doesn't matter if it's bad. Just finish it somehow."" I couldn't convince myself that what I doing was good.

3123,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I’m in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

“You went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.”  
“You’ve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won’t make enough because of it to make that ok”

“Your almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??”

It’s the answer to the last one that makes me realize I’ve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I’ve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I’m a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn’t know I just couldn’t hack it academically, even though I’ve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn’t worked, it’s because those around me wouldn’t let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fiancé before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn’t let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream “who cares” and snap everyone around me out of it.

3128,"In finite games (or games where there is a goal, a winner and a loser, and set boundaries), the prize is a title (whether that is being a gold medalist, getting a promotion, or being a degree holder). This is in contrast of infinite games, where there are no winners, and the point of the game is to keep the game going (for example, the game of literature, the game of science, and the game of music). 

Imposter Syndrome typically occurs to me, and maybe some of you, in school or at work (both in which are finite games). The titles that we earn in finite games are titles symbolizing the accomplishments of the past. Having a Harvard degree symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Becoming a director symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Getting a gold medal symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. These titles are not about the present, but the past! These titles are a form of credit that tells the world that we did well in the past; the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Possibly, anxiety from Imposter Syndrome comes from having the titles but being unsure about our capacity to hold up to the expectations of these titles.

How does one hold up to the expectations of these titles? One possibility is to do well enough... in which you later get another title. And then the cycle repeats itself. You can have your high school degree, your bachelors, your masters, and you can be part of the C-suite, and still have Imposter Syndrome. 

My proposed solution, and I know it's easier said than done, is to let go of the expectations and trust that we've been appropriately given the title. There is no way that *all* these people, institutions, and systems were wrong. Since part of the anxiety is not meeting expectations, another thing that can be done is focusing on the present and do the best we can - the chances are that we can meet expectations.

3146,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I have my Master's in industrial engineering but I have no clue how to put any of my textbooks to use. Feeling so confused on what to do, and I shouldn't be at all. 

I have to do research on a type of manufacturing process for this as well, because my boss is trusting me to understand how it works. I've just been at home playing Minecraft instead. It's like I *want* to show up unprepared, and the more I think about doing the research, the less I'm able to get done and the more angry I am with myself.

I'll even throw in the anxiety I have about getting there on time. Call time is 6 am, and I live an hour away with my mom. Waking up at 4:30-4:45 is just something I'm unfamiliar with, and I'm worried I can't do it. I've been taking melatonin supplements (in gummies) about an hour earlier and earlier for the past few days, and it definitely has made me sleepier. I fell asleep around 11; now it's 3:30 am and I can't fall asleep again. Trying but I've been up for about an hour. 

I feel like I'm going to be fired before I even get comfortable. I'm so worried I can't do any of this but I want to still try. I just feel like I'm so out of my wheelhouse and I don't understand why - this position was (literally) custom-made for me so I could fit in. I just need a way to calm down and I could really use some advice.",anticipation

I failed a class last semester and for some reason it hasn't hit me. I know I'm supposed to feel bad about it but when I see the failing number, I don't know what I feel. I hate talking about grades, some days they matter and other days they don't.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university. The stuff with new guidelines but no updates and whenever I get an update email I tell myself I'll read it later but never do it. Even though it's easier than ever to get in touch in a person with just a click of a button it feels even harder because I don't know who I'm getting in touch with.

I know that I've got bad study habits but breaking them feels impossible. I have good intentions of bettering myself but the rest of my body doesn't listen to my mind. When I tell myself I'll set a routine, I set it, then I don't follow it. I'm just really lost right now.

Now, by working remotely, conversations with other co-workers are not so frequent and that makes me think everybody is working harder than I am. 

I also had this feeling that my supervisors are constantly looking at the chat to spot if I am online or not and whenever I did a break, I felt guilty and I tried to be back at work as soon as possible because my brain kept telling me ""Your boss probably has already called several times and you are here....having lunch.....pffff, you really do not deserve this job"". 

Well, once I started to ignore these thoughts and take my time to have lunch or to have a conversation with my family, I felt much better.

3181,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",trust

3183,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them.

I took up a job at a small company and I was happy with it even though the pay wasn't as much. I got contacted by a recruiter for a big Mnc and given that it was the company of my dreams, I immediately took up the offer. 2 yrs into the job I decided to pursue a more managerial role. My work was recognized and I got promoted to a technical manager position. It has been 4 months and I have been dealing with a lot of big bosses and colleagues in much higher up positions and with a lot more experience than I have. 
I feel I am not qualified enough to talk to them either at a technical level or at a managerial level. I overthink and keep making what I think are mistakes. I don't know what others think of me and I feel stressed out just thinking about it. I want to know if I am going in the right direction and I have scheduled a meeting with my boss regarding this. But now it scares me if he says he isn't happy with my performance. I am continually under stress and I need to know that I am not alone who continuously doubts herself. I might be a little incoherent but I don't know how best to put what I am feeling in words. Any tips or relatable learning experiences would be welcome!!",trust
3187,"So my fiancé is probably one of the hardest workers I’ve ever seen. She has been promoted multiple times, recognized by higher-ups, complements galore, etc., yet she still doubts herself. Heavily...

The most recent example was that her company laid off her entire team (8 people), but kept her because, well...she’s awesome! This morning she was telling me that she’s basically not good enough for this role among other thing. She was also perturbed that some of the district managers that she worked with previously have not wished her good luck with the new role. And it irritates her.This was after many, many, other people complimenting/congratulating her.

She is finally seeing a therapist and her therapist diagnosed her with IS. I am diagnosed OCD and I know I do things that annoy her, but she does whatever she can to help me, so how can I help her? 

I get so frustrated that she’s verbally harming herself when it comes to her job and other things she does (like decorating the house). I tell her genuinely that I think she is amazing and I just kind of get to a boiling point where I don’t know what to do and we start arguing. Please help!

She thinks she will get fired sometimes to, but they keep promoting her lol. I’m just so proud of her! And she has such a big heart for an aggressive hard worker too!

3192,"2 daily examples of imposter syndrome: 

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly. Sometimes if I have a backup or another I feel more comfortable using it. What made me realize it is my laptop, the surface pro 3 I got 5 years ago I've always felt weird using it, but now that I was just given the pro 7 for Christmas I feel way more comfortable using the old one because I know if it breaks I'll have another chance. (poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

Also last night going to bed I had the thought, ""I can't believe I'm not homeless"". A huge part of my imposter syndrome rn is being mostly financially dependent on my mom and not having financial independence yet. (28F) So I practice gratitude at night in bed, being thankful I have a place to sleep and thankful for my body. My bed is the only place I feel emotionally safe.

I've somehow managed to build this reputation of being a confident, self-assured, sociable guy but inside I feel like I'm really not. Those qualities listed above are what I believe to be the way that people perceive me (based on what they've said and that I've heard) but I don't consider myself any of those things. 

They all assume I'm extroverted and confident, the topic has come up before, but I get socially anxious about speaking up, I stutter a lot, my mind blanks while I speak, I dwell over interactions way after they're done. But somehow, on the outside that doesn't come across. So I start getting treated as a person that I really am not. At times it can make me very uncomfortable and I'm subjected to expectations that I am not able to meet. 

Now, the thing is, I like being perceived this way. It's nice that people think you're self-assured and confident but am I just being a faker?

One of my professors in school would have me do reframing techniques and keeping a diary. It was a way for me to stop doubting myself so much, realize what I've accomplished and the value I've created.  The process reframed how I looked at some situations and how I looked at myself. 

I recently did this in a roundabout way. I hired someone to do a bio, career history for me for a professional reason. I couldn't see all that I had accomplished myself and was struggling to see myself beyond the tasks I had carried out. As I was working with this person and the questions they asked I realized I needed to reframe again because I had lost sight of my value and validity.

Reframing is a technique that can help us refocus our feelings of inadequacy and create a balanced mental model of how we perceive ourselves or situations. Below is a link to an online interactive app that allows you to reframe.  

Use this to realize failure is a learning opportunity and reaffirm your success, validity, accomplishments, contributions and value. Also if you have other ideas you want a different perspective on this tool can help. I don't know who created it I was just looking for a reframing worksheet and found this instead.

But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.
* The usual imposter stuff--""everyone at work finds me annoying/doesn't want to work with me, I don't belong there,"" etc. etc. etc.

3209,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me “there were people who did not want to employ you” and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either “I think you are an idiot” or “you are now fired”. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of “I am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...”. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn’t 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It’s silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don’t remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager’s manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I’ve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it’s ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",trust

Last night I met my SO's parents. They're well-to-do: Wealthy, accomplished, connected - the whole bit.   
They were completely warm and welcoming and the evening was fine. 

Although they are not in the least bit pretentious and did nothing to elicit these feelings, I left feeling inadequate and ashamed. I left feeling small. 

I am smart and have a career trajectory that I know people find impressive. In theory, I belong. But even so, I felt so much less than them. Honestly, afterward, I wanted to curl up into a ball. 

It's hard to divorce the person you are today from where or how you grew up. 

No amount of wealth or success seems to alter that internal, mental image of yourself as that kid from that not-so-great family. 

As I spend more and more of my personal and professional time with increasingly affluent, privileged people, I come to realize all that I didn't have growing up. It comes in waves, all things I do not know. Sometimes it's the small things (a butter keeper - what's that?) and sometimes it's the larger things, all the social norms of the classes above me that I'm still learning. 

I worry I stick out like a sore thumb. I worry I'm not worth the same as these other people. But then what is the worth of a human life? I know it's more than butter keepers and Ivy League educations. But why does the lack of those things sometimes hurt so badly, create such feelings of inadequacy?",sadness

3241,"My tutoring company has been doing remote work due to COVID, and they are starting to look into some in-person tutoring, given that both the client and tutor are comfortable. I have the option of being an in-person tutor again, in which I get paid a little more. I'm not personally scared of COVID from tutoring, so I am considering it. I worry though about being a good enough tutor. And so far the two students I've had who switched tutors—I'm assuming because they didn't like me—were ones I went to see in person, as opposed to in the office or remote. 

If I may vent, I was academically successful until college, at which point, I got by. I mean, I went to a prestigious STEM school and graduated in good standing with a BS in CS-Math. I think I got honors in CS. And I love helping people, tutored on-campus, and even tutored young kids over the phone. So I'm capable.

However, I'm not confident. And I don't do well under pressure. Like once I was doing an interview, I was asked to calculate the value of 5/8 without a calculator. I said 1.6 or something. At which point, the interviewer guided me to the realization that 5/8 is less than 1, so how is 1.6 reasonable?

I've had my tutoring job for less than a year. But I have been in it for over half a year, so I think I'm past the ""oh, you're new, mistakes happen"" phase. I believe I have the foundational knowledge I need, but I don't think I have the... sufficient knowledge that other tutors seem to have to confidently answer any kid's question. I find myself often saying that I need to get back to a kid on that. I don't know all the answers, despite having resources, answer keys, and time to plan. Nor am I motivated to give even more time to learning as I have already. 

So I feel like an imposter. Either because I am less competent than my fellow tutors or because I don't want to put in the effort I'd need to be as competent as them. 

Yesterday, I had one remote lesson to teach in the evening. All day I'd been anxious about it. It wasn't horrible anxiety, but it was present. And the lesson was fine. I expected it to be fine. But I still felt scared. 

I feel like an imposter. And I don't like it. But this tutoring job is so flexible and has such a respectful community, that I don't think I should give it up. If something feels wrong, I figure I must be at fault. 

tl;dr I do feel like an imposter. I think I just wanted to vent. If anyone has advice, that'd be cool, too.",trust

I’ve always been smart and have even (ironically) helped people reach their dreams through writing papers, blogs and assignments . But when it came time for me to look to go back and finish, I became anxious and felt unworthy because of how it ended and what my life had become.

3250,"New here. I work in film and theatre, or at least I'm trying to get into that industry as an actor/screenwriter/director. I like to do more than one thing. It's the sort of career where you learn on the job by speaking to other people and working with them. In short, you need to network like a fox. But I can't ask for help. If I did, I would be too terrified to be ridiculed and torn down because it's so obvious that I don't know what I'm doing and I would be exposed as a fraud, a pathetic laughing stock and a failure. But I need to ask for help to learn the skills to do my job. It's a vicious cycle. I grew up in the care system surrounded by narcissistic people and jaded social workers who just wanted to end the conversation and go home for their dinner instead of giving a shit about you or their job. Their favourite word was ""no"". Aiming to achieve anything other than working in a minimum wage job and living in a crap one bedroom flat was discouraged. So I had to go into every single meeting with them every 6-8 weeks feeling armed to the teeth for battle and it was exhausting. If I wanted or needed something I would have to plan an entire TEDx talk to get through it and if they found one single area in my idea that wasn't quite developed yet, they would be like ""AHA!"", and jump right in there to tear me down and keep me under their boot. I was constantly reminded of how I was a stupid little girl living in a fantasy world and had no idea what I was doing or what reality was. They would straight up make fun of you. But they never taught me anything to help me with normal life either because they want you to stay helpless and rely on the system, and then judged me for not having a clue how to do simple things despite it being their responsibility to teach you. You weren't allowed to do anything for yourself (and there were often consequences when you tried to) and then at a certain age, they expected you to just magically be able to do it. So now if I want to do anything at all, even the simplest of things like asking someone how I write a script, I can't. I'm too afraid that the rest of the world is exactly like them. I don't want them to laugh at me if I want to make films and have no idea where to start. If I try to overwhelm myself by doing everything, I fail.

3253,"A quick note - I only discovered information about imposter syndrome within the past 24 hours and I feel like I have really discovered what has been happening to me most of my life. 

&nbsp;


Last year I was offered a Leadership/Management Internship position at Walt Disney World - something that I have worked towards since my high school grad in 2011! I was placed into housekeeping leadership though I had no prior experience in it (all my leadership experience was front desk or merchandise) so I felt like I was thrown into unfamiliar territory. 


&nbsp;


I was there for about 6 months (internship was for 1 year and a potential permanent position was available at the end of it), assisted in opening a new resort, and about 3 months in I began to have extreme anxiety attacks at work - I would lock myself in my office and cry and have trouble catching my breath. The role as a leader wasn’t difficult per se, the role itself was something that I could do on a day to day basis. I told my parents and my s/o that I was out-of-place, that I missed guest interaction (there was little to no daily guest interaction unless there was a guest to apologize to), and that I felt like I didn’t fit in.


&nbsp;


Whereas those were all the truth, I feel like I didn’t tell them the full truth. I am extremely terrified of failing and letting people down. I felt like in a position of leadership at this level, I had so much daily weight put on me and I was scared I would fail (even though I had only received praise from my peers and those above me). Eventually I was struggling to get out of bed for what was meant to be my “dream job”, or at least the start of it. I began to question what I wanted to for so long. I left that position and took a general merchandiser position (non-leadership) within the parks and now I feel so unfulfilled but worried to try to step into a leadership position. I’m not even sure what I’m looking for...advice or validation? I’m terrified of applying for another leadership position in fear that this will happen again..I have no idea.

3254,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

End of rant",trust
3255,"I guess I just need to get this out and see if this mirrors anyone else's experience.

Or if I'm just completely out of my mind.

My therapist definitely believes I have impostor syndrome. This is based on some information I explained to him. In my classes (senior in college), for example, I received an A on both term papers for both courses last term, a 97% and a 98%. And I am still waiting for the grade to be lowered because SURELY these professionals have to figure out that it's all fraudulent. The school I go to uses turn it in and I am able to see my results, both had low %s meaning the content was original, yet I'm still convinced somehow I must've cheated on the assignments. Logically, I know I did not, I remember the painstaking and grueling hours reading the research, putting them together and writing it out in the APA format. I also did well on the quizzes. I can't fathom that I have gotten those grades on my own but I know, logically, I did.

I am also a community activist locally. I don't do anything major or impressive--but it requires me to confront politicians and community leaders with a ton of stats and facts. I am known for my skills in researching and strategy on these topics. I am by no means a mastermind. But I am often able to cite case studies and statistics --yet, even though I've done the hours of research, written them down into an essay, presented them and even have had them double checked, I constantly have to re-check the information before speaking on them again, as I am convinced I have them wrong or made them up. 

This all sounds like impostor syndrome to me--but the part that I never hear about it and I wonder if anyone else deals with this or if its a totally different ""syndrome"". I don't just expect to exposed as a fraud, I expect to be exposed as a horrible human being. I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, most of which I've at least made an effort to atone for, but I am constantly waiting for my ""horrid actions"" to bd exposed--and often times, they are imagined actions or they are based on real events but ""modified"".

One example and I know this sounds strange: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up 3 years ago (almost). And it was a nasty fight, I was crude and petty. The relationship NEEDED to end. I regret how I ended it. But we made amends for both of our wrongdoings throughout the relationship and while we've maintained a healthy emotional distance since then, when we see each other (pre-COVID) we say hi, we've had some small social media interactions and we've even discussed the end of our relationship. In fact, we respect each other very much and the relationship. Yet, nonsensically, I've ""imagined"" him ""exposing"" me as this horrid person who destroyed his life. I know that's not going to happen and it's not true--but it has become to the point that I actually thought I was going to lose all my friends and my standing in my community over it. But there's no actual basis for this. 

I also am frequently expecting the law to come to me and ""catch me"" for the horrible crimes I've committed. I fear being caught, but not for anything I've done, but rather, that I'll be ""planted"" and charged. Now, I am a community activist but not high level enough to worry about that happening.

All of this is based on non-sense. And I have not been diagnosed with anything like psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't have auditory or visual hallucinations. But I am constantly surrounded by guilt and feelings of inadequacy, which I believe is beyond the average persons standard of self-doubt and insecurity.

Thank you for letting me share and I know I sound ""crazy"". If you have any advice or resources, or similar stories (even if you would prefer to share them in a private message), I'm here to listen.

I can’t take a compliment or accept their praise and they get frustrated, even verbally angry at me for not “understanding my worth”. This has lead to tension between my mother and I because she always wanted to uplift me and I felt guilty, as she was wasting time and energy on me. I then feel guilty that I’m rejecting love and support when there are a lot of people who are not fortunate enough to have a mother so loving. It’s sends me in a spiral, further enforcing my belief that I don’t deserve anything good, I was just lucky enough to be given a mom like her.

She passed away 7 months ago. I never got to tell her how grateful I am to have her constant support while I was struggling, (with mental illness and sobriety). I miss her more than words can describe.

One thing I hate is people telling me that I’m doing surprisingly well dealing with her death, which I take as a back handed compliment. Shouldn’t I be grieving more dramatically because she was so important to me? Why am I happy sometimes even though she’s gone? Are people expecting me to relapse because of the tragedy? How can people say that they admire my bravery and strength to carry on, especially when I spend hours stuck in the past, trying to remember her?

I feel like I’m only “doing surprisingly well” because I have shoved everything down and I am not working hard enough in therapy to address my grief, I’m only repeating what I’ve read in books or posts of what the stages of dealing with grief look and sound like. I lie about my feelings to everyone, even my therapist. My therapist praises me for not relapsing into self destructing habits, but I feel like I haven’t fallen back on those because I don’t want to disappoint my mom, even though she is no longer here. The idea that I’m “strong” is scary to me. I feel like these compliments create so much doubt in my head, causing me to relapse because that is what is expected of me. 

Through all of this, I don’t have my mom’s unconditional support to fall back on when I feel my life is a sham, I don’t have that one person who loves me no matter who I think or pretend I am. It’s tricky navigating my thoughts and feelings alone and I feel like I’ve been killing myself looking for reassurance from other sources, like my work or social media, so much so that I have neglected working on my relationships with my family, who is hurting too. I don’t want to let them down the same way I let my mom down so many times, nor do I want to have them worry about me, or spend time and energy trying to support me as I will never truly feel validated. They should just continue believing I am “doing surprisingly well” even though I know I am faking it.

I know I have to ask for help in order to get this done and I only have a bachelor’s degree so i shouldn’t beat myself up about not understanding Master’s/PhD level physics concepts but I cant help it (especially considering i’ve applied to PhD programs recently)

I just keep wondering how I got this far, graduated with multiple honors and scholarships and feel like I got so lucky with many of my achievements though on a higher level I know I worked my butt off for them.

Does anyone relate to this fear of asking for help, or have a good piece of advice they’ve learned? I would love to know how you manage your own inner negative voice!

For example, when I don’t hear anything from my boss on where a PowerPoint deck stands that was supposedly due today I start freaking out thinking I’ve been left out of the loop. One part of me wants to think think no news is good news, but another part thinks he’s figured out I’m not contributing anything so he cuts me out of the chain of communication.

It’s tough times for everyone at the moment so I try not to reach out too much to others to gather “facts” to dispute my fears, but in the meantime I’m driving myself nuts. I want to use the time more productively than just worrying. Part of me would even like to say if I’m out of job - so be it - start working on enhancing other skills so I’m ready for the next steps....but I can’t get past this.

I am a medical student in the US and imposter syndrome hit me hard when I first started medical school - someone people have told me that it never really goes away so I should just find a way to deal with it through various wellness practices. 

While I still feel it now, a couple years ago I was overworking myself to the point where I was not eating all day until 8-9PM, not taking breaks, and not being social so I wanted to write a post for anyone who can relate to my experience. It took me a long time to acknowledge that I have imposter syndrome and that's totally okay, but because I realized that now I try as much as I can to not let it dictate my life. 

If you are all interested, I write more about my experiences in my blog (I have a lot of down time right now because all of our clinical work is suspended).

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr. I learned recently that she consistently tops their exams, amidst her peers who, like me, finished from top universities. I can't help but feel that this only reinforces my own imposter syndrome. If my friend who went to the same unknown university as I did, performed as well as me, even getting the exact same honor and exact same score in the medical admission test I did, yet she's performing spectacularly in med school whereas I'm now below average, then it only means I really did just luck out on my achievements so far. Heck maybe my professors in college were generous and awarded me top-notch grades. Maybe she had stricter professors who would've given her a better mark if she's been their student.",trust

I recently started playing the video game Fortnite again as a method to release stress, I found out that they have added low skilled bots to the game to make more fun for less skilled player like myself. (You can get some easy eliminations and thus more confidence and practice). But here’s where it kicked in. When I started making it to the top 5 in all the matches I was questioning; “am I so bad that I’m getting loaded into a match with 99 bots and me?” So every elimination I just assume is a bot even if it’s obviously not lol.",joy

He's an aerospace engineering major and has all really great grades, while I am psych and pre-med. He is so kind and funny cute and has all these amazing qualities I feel like I don't, and that he should be with someone better. I believe I am just wasting people's time and money to go to school and be with my bf, and I feel like I am a horrible person because of it because I don't believe I have worked hard enough or tried hard enough or that I am a good enough person who deserves to be here at university, or in this relationship, or anything at all.

I studied all I could for that exam, and got a 70 (average of the class was 80), and I was fine with that, but the professor wrote ""expected more. Can do better"" on the cover of my exam.

I have no doubt I have imposter syndrome, but that just made me feel so bad about myself, because 1-I gave my best to study for this exam and he did not know my situation and 2-I don't think I would have done any better had I had more time to study, because my grades are usually a little below average. I am not as smart as people think I am (I am very quiet, go to every lecture, so I think other people have that impression).

I am always so stressed when I have meetings to present my work to my mentors, even though in the end they almost always say I’ve done a good job.

3316,"What's the psychology behind Imposter Syndrome?

If I were to reply that question based on my experience with imposter syndrome, I'll say it's because I expect people to acknowledge my capabilities the way I imagine I'd have done it to someone else. But how often do I compliment someone else irl? It's quite rare that I pat on a friend or a relative's back to celebrate their accomplishments. This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.

I feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions. This is why this sort of compliments feel diluted like it's not meaningful enough to digest as truthful.

However, in real life, I work as a software developer and whenever my boss or the seniors compliment me (which rarely happens) on something I did, suddenly all of that worries instantly go away but unfortunately, it's only temporary. I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.

A potential cure?

I think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us. For me, those people are my parents, my brother, my boss, the seniors at work and a couple of colleagues in my rank. I believe that if one wants their imposter syndrome to completely go away, they're gonna have to maximise the amount of compliments they want to generate from these meaningful people. The compliment may not be physically expressed but it could also be subtle as in an increase in the respect people have for you.

In order to please those people, you're gonna have to 'git gud' in life. Work on yourself constantly, keep improving yourself. Always be active. Always ask for something to do. Try to work on the bank of knowledge of your department if you work in software. During my spare time, not only do I browse Reddit but I have tabs of research materials open. I gather knowledge which my team will need in the future and I present them during meeting.

Work your way up the hierarchy of competence and you'll notice your imposter syndrome will slowly fade away. The way people will look at you will be different. They will smile at you. They will be happy to work with you and to me, that's the one effective way to combat against that horrible, horrible thing called imposter syndrome. Get GOOD!",trust
3317,"I’m a uni student and I was originally a mechanical engineer. I spent about a year and a half doing that. I always felt like everybody else in the class was way smarter than me and I felt outcasted. I made some friends through my classes but I still felt like I was too stupid to be there, despite having pretty okay grades. Fast forward to last semester, I changed majors to architecture, as I felt it was a better fit for me. It was more challenging to me in the way where we were constantly reviewing other students work. I was constantly being told what I was doing wrong but also what I can do better. This had a negative affect on me for a couple months but now I am seeing it as constructive. I definitely still feel a competitive challenge with my other classmates, but we are helping each other through it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it.

but its just especially prevalent with new things. i cant get into things easily.  i constantly think about the people who know more, have been around longer, are better at the videogames, what have you.   makes me feel like trying to find ""my"" thing, but i dont have a thing.   ""jack of all trades, master of none, better than a master of one"", but that doesnt feel true. i wish i was really good at one thing.  i feel im straying from my original issue, but well, its that i cant commit to anything.  my passions are flimsy, i never feel completely immersed in anything--instrument, music, movies, drawing, videogames, skilltoys; i do all these different things but i never completely can give myself permission to just enjoy something fully.  i always feel sortof detached no matter what i do--and that also prevents me from really excelling at anything, i think.     


but it also feels like a depression thing.  it feels sorta cyclical; cant get immersed-->dont feel enjoyment-->cant get immersed.  which came first, idk, but the result is me being more or less numb.    and t his extends to so much beyond just liking things. its like part of who and how i am.   like afraid to be real.  so afraid that i forget how to stop being afraid, and when i start to mellow out, i get anxious becuse suddenly there's a weight to everything.  to social interactions. to the real world.  and then i go numb again, because its safer to have this hyper-aware, low level anxiety combined with a detachment from personal feelings, than to actually feel.   but feeling is what makes life worth living, obviously.   gotta take the good with the bad, or neither and end up with nothing.  but the bad psyches me out to the point of giving up on anything i started to be passionate about--thus cyclical.  its like my choices are: feel too much, or feel nothing.  yeah this is definitely beyond just imposter syndrome, but it also feels like it isnt. like its a part of imposter syndrome.

Think about it. For the other imposter types listed, even if internally they feel like a mess, there are still some external benefits to their internal insecurity.

1. The perfectionist will still strive for that 100%. Even if they do miss that 1%, they are still going to probably be 99% better than most people.
2. The superwoman/man will work harder than anyone else. Even if they are insecure, their efforts show up in their work and gain them respect.
3. The expert gathers every piece of information and knowledge that they can. Even if their knowledge is incomplete, they still know more than probably the average person.

But the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist""? Lord help them. And by Lord help them, I mean Lord help me LMAO.

1. The soloist is fighting a losing battle. They are trying to go it alone WHILE also trying to be perfect. We all need mentors and teachers to help us to learn things! People will think that you are arrogant because you are trying to learn things on your own. And you most likely will also fail because who can succeed without the help of others?
2. And the ""natural genius""? Oh my goodness, this is even worse! Think about it: this person (me, lmao) delusionally thinks that they can excel WHILE on minimal effort AND on their first try. They give up easily at the sign of any challenge, because that's a sign that they aren't ""good"" or ""talented"" or ""smart"" enough. Therefore, they never actually excel at anything.

I feel like the first three (perfectionist, superwomen/man, expert) are almost like ""productive"" imposters. People that feel like imposters, but at least do something about it that can somewhat productively counteract those feelings.

But the bottom two, which I unfortunately am? It's like where you feel like you are an imposter, and instead of at the very least compensating for it, you just try to hide it... by trying to go it alone so that no one can see your imperfections at least for a short while (soloist) or by only ever sticking to things that are ""easy"" so that you can pretend like you are some sort of ""natural genius"" of some sort.

But I'm still suffering the same thing. I no longer have the confidence to speak in a group of people, I always fear that they will remark something true about me. Figure me out before I finish.

Can't make many friends neither, they always seem to find out how weak I am and take advantage of me. Especially with women, I'm black so I date black girls. If you know black girls you know how mean they can be. Or maybe that's how I want to think of them.

They say I'm not bad looking, so girls sometimes get attracted to me. When they do I panic. Not because I'm scared of them, I've had girlfriends before but broke it off before they got too near. When girls want me I run away, I'm so afraid that they'll know what I'm all about. That I'm just a smoke screen for nothing that lies behind, hollow as can be.

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female.  I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work.  Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon.  My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack.  For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

&#x200B;

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud.  As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear.  I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome.  I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too.  Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it.  I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

&#x200B;

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten.  I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after.  I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter.  I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME.  I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me.  ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ <--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it.  I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

&#x200B;

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself.  But I am definitely in crisis.  The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline.  The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it.  I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me.  I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me.  That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

&#x200B;

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work.  I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth.  I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents).  I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is.  He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere.  I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me.  So I try to make him as happy as possible.  He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

&#x200B;

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life.  And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have.  In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can.  I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON.  Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine.  But I lie.  My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason.  I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day.  I ignore them.  One of these bills is for $8.  Eight fucking dollars.  I'm paralyzed about it.  I won't fix it.  These are only a few aspects of my life as examples.  I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships.  I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having.  I lie about having other plans.  I deserve to have my life fucked up.  I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway.  At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it...  It feels like my whole world is upside down.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, thank you.  I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this.  The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

&#x200B;

This is the first day of my life.  Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where.  I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing.  I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

&#x200B;

3346,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn’t put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn’t. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family’s and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if’s. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it’s why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I’ve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what’s looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don’t look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it’s offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don’t have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We’ll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don’t feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don’t treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven’t earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn’t earn it, that’s bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that’s where you go so ride it out. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don’t go down the dark hole there’s nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.


If you suffer badly from this i suggest reading the book, “ The Alchemist”

God luck guys!

I have been to the depths of imposter hell and crawled my way back up over years and now wear those scars like a badge of Fucking honor. If anybody of you need somebody to chat with or help feel Free to reach out I’d love to keep rock bottom at a very low vacancy as it’s not somewhere you want to go.

Hi all,

I (27F) have always had ups and downs with anxiety, confidence and insecurity. I'm going through a rather difficult patch at the moment. I'm a journalist and I've just started a new job. I used to work on long form documentaries but making the switch back to daily news is really daunting.

I went through a very competitive interview process to get here, and I've always received very positive feedback on my work in every other job. So logically, I should feel like getting this job is really well-deserved.

However, the other members of the team are extremely good - intimidatingly so. There are many people here with a lot more experience than me (even the more junior members of the team) who seem to be far fuller of ideas than I am and much more vocal. They approach their work with a confidence and conviction that I can never see myself having.

I am much shyer than my coworkers and struggle to speak up in meetings. I have been trying to force myself to do this more, and even recently spoke at a public event to try and gain more confidence. It hasn't got any easier at all, and I still cringe when I hear myself speaking in front of a large group. I don't feel like my ideas are as original, creative, fully formed and well-thought out as the ones many others pitch. I spend hours researching topics I'm interested in, but I struggle to form proper stories out of my ideas and therefore don't pitch very often. I know I should arrange a meeting with my boss to talk about these issues, but I feel like they are always so busy and I don't want them to think they've made a mistake by hiring me if I highlight my insecurities.

Because I'm so intimidated by my coworkers, I feel reluctant to start conversations or even make small talk with them, even though I know I would benefit from doing this and learn a lot from them. I know it actually looks worse that I'm not taking the time to engage with them, but the thought of doing so makes me anxious.

I just feel like a great big fraud, really. I want to become a really good journalist, but I know this anxiety and lack of self-esteem is really holding me back.

Does anyone else here have similar experiences at work? Any tips that might help?

TL;DR: I'm struggling with imposter syndrome at work and it's affecting my ability to do my job and form relationships with my team. Any advice or details of similar experiences much appreciated!",fear

3350,"Soo I have a long list of illnesses/disabilities and I always feel like I'm lying about them.
Ever since I was little, I was taught that I was not as sick as I felt and just talking myself into it/faking it. The reasoning behind this was that I should learn to go to school no matter what because when you are a working adult you can't always be sick either. I also had a friend who was anxious about getting sick and dying because of every little discomfort (hypochondriac) and it made me scared that I could have the same disorder instead of being actually sick.

One moment I feel like this thinking has had a major impact on my physical health because I didnt take symptoms seriously, then I feel like an imposter who only feels sorry for themselves. Every time I have any symptoms I feel like a pussy and I had to learn the hard way that I have to take breaks for my immune system, I now have severe asthma with biweekly attacks.

3354,"Hi everyone!

I've  been on a journey to improve my mental well-being and develop healthier thought patterns. Over the past year, I've faced challenges with  anxiety and found it difficult to break out of negative thought cycles. A. I  tried mindfulness exercises, but however hard I tried, I couldn't shut  off my thoughts. That's why I started looking for a different approach. That's when I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I started  challenging my unrealistic thoughts and learned how to react to them in a  more reasonable way.

However, doing this on your own, instead of with a therapist, is difficult. Even if you have a therapist, you only get help once a week instead of every time you are struggling with negative thoughts. So, I took matters  into my own hands and developed an app to make the process more  accessible and user-friendly. Here's how the app works:

1. Write a note whenever you find yourself overwhelmed by unhelpful thoughts.
2. The app analyzes your note, identifying common cognitive distortions.
3. Receive personalized suggestions to challenge and reframe your thoughts.

I've already got a couple hundred users and great feedback but I feel like imposter syndrome is basically the definition of distorted thinking, so I thought this might help a lot of you fighting imposter syndrome, and help me tailor the apps to your needs. The app is available as a beta on iOS and Android. 

If you're interested in trying it out and sharing your thoughts, please leave a comment or send me a direct message or join the Discord community where you can find all links you need: [https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3](https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3)

3355,"Maybe it’s just been a rough week but I just feel like I’m not cut out to be a tax accountant.

Long story short - I graduated college at the end of 2019 and started my first accounting job out of college at a really small firm, with no previous experience. I prepared mostly personal taxes, a few 1120s and 1065s, and was also involved in bookkeeping. There was minimal training and I really learned what I could from asking questions and just doing the work. I was with them for over 2 1/2 years but decided to leave due to off season stress of not having enough work (if I had no work they wouldn’t let me study for my CPA either) and the fact I didn’t see myself being promoted anytime soon (I was the only staff for a good 6 months towards the end).

I decided to go to a mid level firm and accepted a staff roll. I’ve loved it so far and love all the opportunities I’m being given to work on bigger clients and focus on my weaker areas. However, I feel like coming in with 2 1/2 years I didn’t expect to have such a learning curve (I definitely knew I would come in with less experience in certain areas) Coming from a state with no income tax, working on mostly individuals, and having no actual formal training other than just on the job has put me at a disadvantage. I feel so dumb compared to other staff. I’ve been put on large clients with multi-state returns, and many things I haven’t seen before (Which I’ve disclosed). I’ve tried my best to learn; but everything takes me longer, I’m still perfecting and trying to make my work papers clean, and I feel like I‘m not doing good enough :( During engagement meetings I try and take very detailed notes - but I feel like I always miss something. Or my work papers aren’t done quite the right way for the reviewer - or I just misunderstand what should be done. I want to ask more questions, but I either feel too stupid or don’t know what to ask (Like I think I do understand something - when in reality I don’t) Most of the smaller returns I've worked  on I’ve gotten good feedback on. I haven’t gotten any bad feedback so far - I can just know that it takes a lot more patience to work with me on bigger projects/ returns right now and certain reviewers probably get frustrated with me. I’ve started to get anxiety while I’m working again and I don’t feel like I’m meeting expectations. I don’t feel like I can turn down work since I still am trying to prove myself and work with a variety of people - I’ve taken maybe 2 actual days of PTO since busy season ended and I’m just feeling stressed. I’m just trying to keep pushing through knowing that maybe there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s so frustrating after being in accounting as a staff for almost 3 1/2 years to feel this way, is accounting even what I want to pursue? Will I ever get better? I really want to be a CPA but I just feel like I’m too stupid. I feel like all my friends are getting promoted and doing amazing and their jobs just love them. I’m 25 and I just don’t feel like I’m ever going to be successful :( 

It’s been a rough year for me with personal tragedy occurring in the middle of busy season as well. I’m in therapy to work on managing my busy schedule (both personally and at work) as well as work through some childhood trauma. I definitely feel like my personal issues during busy season did affect my work and motivation - but I’m trying to get back into it and I just don’t feel like I’m doing enough.",trust
3356,"I’m so beyond grateful for the support of my family, friends, and boyfriend and their words of congratulations to me. A small part of me thinks “yeah I did that, I accomplished it,” but the bigger part of me doesn’t know why I feel nothing.

My time as a piano major was extremely stressful, not in the academic way but in a personal way that was tied to my professors. After graduating from my two year college, my private instructor there cut me off completely. It was confusing because we were so close, she was someone I told everything to. My last conversation with her, I revealed to her that my sister was taken by CPS and I was diagnosed with RA. I tried to follow up with her but she never responded. I don’t resent her for it, I’m still very confused and hurt that after 2-3 years of talking to her almost everyday, she refused to say hello or even ask how I was doing after transferring to university.

Almost immediately after moving away from family to continue my studies, I learned about my sister and CPS and it impacted my ability to focus or perform, which is huge since I was literally a performance major and I was performing every week. I thought I had gained trust with one of my piano professors, so I told him what was going on. He was so supportive until my last day of class when he told me how disappointed he was in my final class performance but that he would still give me an A out of pity for me. That should’ve made me feel grateful but I felt so humiliated. In my last year at university, my new private lesson instructor made me feel like I had learned nothing while at school, saying I wouldn’t pass my recital hearing (basically a test to see if I’m ready to perform my senior recital) and even threatening my graduation date. He would also say things like “you haven’t made any progress” but in the same breath tell me I’ve come a long way, which confused me. Small things like that added up to an entire list, most of which is made up of negative commentary.

Now I’m not going to pretend like I deserve only praise. I’m well aware that I’m not a prodigy and that I’m not going to make a career out of performing because it’s not something I feel I have the constitution for. Sure, I enjoy the occasional performance especially in front of audiences that are supportive and want to hear what I have to share. I actually just had my debut in Colombia in April where I got to teach a masterclass and then perform in the concert hall in front of 500 people. They were so incredibly kind and they are still reaching out to me to tell me how much they loved hearing me play.

So why, after seeing my own progress and being happy with how I progressed, especially as someone in a field where there are so many incredible and inspiring musicians, do I feel like I didn’t do what I was supposed to? I used to be so proud of the music I shared because I genuinely felt like I was meant to do this, but then hearing these professors who used to attend Juilliard and Curtis and had well-established careers that I’m a disappointment made me feel like no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be worthy of praise. And now that I have my degree, all I can think about is the pain associated with my years at college. That I may have improved slightly but in the long run, it doesn’t matter.",trust

She was saying how brilliant I am with the solutions I've implemented at work and all I could think was just... I'm not though, I literally googled everything I did. Every line of code almost I wrote was copied/pasted from something else and fitted for my use case.

Every solution I've done to accommodate a business need, someone else could have done it.

I don't understand how my coworkers and peers give me all these glowing reviews when I don't even know why I'm getting paid as much as I am and the guilt I feel is intense.

I learned how to take the compliment though instead of saying ""Well I just googled this or that"", I just said thank you. So that's progress I guess.",trust

It was already hard enough to try and learn from someone who achieves in this field at a high level with great ease, but today he showed me pictures from his friend’s (who is also an award-winning artist) daughter and I just crumbled. I’m 32, she’s 18. Granted, I just started and I had a career before this- I have a masters in another field, have bought and sold a house, have various talents and achievements…. But I want to be REALLY GOOD at THIS!
 I took art classes in school, have always had skill and natural talent, but never really cultivated it. Seeing someone so young do such great work feels awful. I feel incredibly stupid saying that, and I really am very happy for her, but I just feel like such a fraud. Like I’m getting some kind of special opportunity from my partner that’s not based on my own merit- like I don’t deserve it and will inevitably fail and disappoint everyone. I know it sounds ridiculous… and again… if I say it “out loud” I usually feel better… and more in the realm of reality.
 I’m planning to keep trying and improving and do what I can- but DAMN. I have a huge bill to climb and sometimes I doubt my ability to climb it. I feel like I can’t talk about it (for various reasons) and I’m happy this sub exists so I can vent my frustrations safely… thanks guys.",trust

3369,"I didn't always have the self-esteem to claim that I was an intelligent person, but throughout my childhood, adolescence, and early youth, I did have some flashes of brilliance that made me feel confident in my abilities.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

Due to my grades I thought it would be difficult for me to find a job, but I quickly got a position as an engineer, and two years later I am still in the same company where I have a position with a high technical profile.

In my day to day I obviously interact with my team, where at the level of academic trajectory, I am clearly at the bottom, if not in the last place. It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

Where I want to get at is that I feel like I ended up here by sheer miracle or by a whim of fate. If I have to be honest, I get to understand the concepts that I work on, but I feel that sometimes it is more difficult for me than others. I like to put this down to the fact that my education wasn't as demanding as theirs, but I do make mistakes sometimes and torture myself. I make some really stupid mistakes, and well, one is fine, but at the end of a project I go through the code and models, and I see a bunch of stupid bugs. I'm writing here because I have a presentation next week in front of the whole team regarding the project I've been working on for two months, and I may have to postpone it due to an error.

3370,"I frequently get imposter syndrome not about my skills but actually about my interests. 

Almost every time I'm interested on something, say sports, music, reading, I get this weird feeling that I'm faking everything, which makes me feel bad when talking to other people about those interests and also while I'm focusing on them.

It's like I think I'm supposed to know everything about something if I'm interested in it. Otherwise I'm just posing.

Just to give an example, there's this rock band I love and some years ago I showed them to my mom and more recently showed her their new album. On the other day my mother told my about this oldie song from them which I didn't know. It is an awesome song, but at that very moment I started feeling like a poser, because if I don't know that song then I don't really know anything about the band and I don't really enjoy them, I'm just faking.

This pattern has happened with almost every interest I get. I love talking to people about my interests and teach things about them, but when the opposite happens I start feeling like I'm a fraud and I'm just pretending to be more interesting than I actually am.

This is how I do it: 

1. Recognize Imposter Syndrome - recognize when the ""monster"" is speaking to you to conquer it
2. Reach out for support - you're not alone, many people go through this
3. Keep reminders of past successes - build a bank of successes you can reference to snap out of it.
4. Practice positive self-talk - refer back to your past successes to be kind to yourself 
5. Manage your thoughts - we think 60,000 thoughts every day, some of those thoughts are trash and you don't have to believe them

I have been at that job for a little over 4 months, and I have constantly felt like they would fire me any day. I was having a hard time with the work and avoided asking for help, in fear that people would find out I don't know anything. There are a lot of problems with that job, but I can't help but feel that the main problem is me. I was thrown into a new project using new technologies, and I struggled.

3380,"I’ve always had issues with imposter syndrome but it’s never been this bad and I don’t know what to do anymore. I am in my last 3 months of graduate school where I am set to complete a dual masters degree with a dual concentration. My GPA is a 3.8, so on paper it sounds like I’m extremely intelligent in my field, but in reality I don’t even know what the day to day work life would look like for someone in my career path. I’m currently completing my Capstone for my degree and I’m struggling horribly with writing just the proposal. I have no idea how to write a sound study design and can’t wrap my head around writing all most 10 pages worth of information on a project that is still far into the future (in terms of data sources, limitations I might have, data analysis). 

When I was in the thick of my graduate curriculum I always received good grades and got things done on time, but I think I just learned how to do homework really well. For example, I was taking my degree at an accelerated rate in order to graduate sooner, so I was completing more classes than was recommended or than what my peers were. Because of this, a lot of the assigned reading/work for each class was doubled so I physically wouldn’t be able to complete all of it exactly as I should’ve, in a timely manner, while also trying to live a life and working full time. My work around was that I would skim a lot of it, and never do any of the optional or supplemental work. I would give the bare minimum of effort on assignments, in order to get an A or high B. And it worked, like I said I completed my curriculum with a high 3.8 GPA. But now… I think I really regret not reading everything word for word. I feel like I can’t even tell you what I learned. 

Now that I am almost done with my degree, which hopefully even freaking happens at this point… I have to start finding a job. I’ve been applying to 10-20 jobs almost everyday and I can’t even get someone to give me an in person interview for an entry level position in my field, and I now have THREE advanced degrees. More so, I sometimes try to imagine some of the field related questions they may ask me when I finally do land one, and I LITERALLY can’t imagine I would know ANY of the answers to anything they may ask. Not to mention, from reading the basic job descriptions I have almost no qualifications…so like why did I even put myself in this much debt for these degrees that apparently mean nothing now?

At this point, I feel like I’ll never succeed in this field, I have dread every day that I’ll horribly embarrass myself in interviews or talks with other similar professionals, and now I don’t even know if this field was for me to begin with.

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",trust

3389,"Hi everyone,

I (fairly) recently got promoted at work, and I’ve been really struggling with what I’m assuming is imposter’s syndrome ever since. :( I’m finding it really really hard. 

My job is research based, originally I was doing more admin tasks and I was quite happy and confident in what I was doing. After my promotion I became more directly involved with conducting the research itself. It’s a big change in my role and the day-to-day activities in my job.

When I went for the promotion, I kind of worried this would happen. I’m a people pleaser, I suffer with social anxiety and OCD, so I did think that this might be too much for me, but there was pressure to go for it from colleagues, friends, family etc. I thought getting promoted would look good to others and therefore make me feel better about myself :( 

However now I’m stuck in the job and I’m just really struggling. We have deadlines, so I feel like I’m constantly rushing to finish things. When I rush, I get stressed because the quality of my work isn’t as good as I feel it should be. I worry there are mistakes that I don’t have time to rectify, then I worry that the mistakes mean I’m not good enough to be in this role. I’m also slower because I meticulously check everything for errors, which I worry doesn’t look good for my performance, further proving to myself that I don’t deserve this job. Generally I’m worried my lack of knowledge is going to be revealed somehow, that there will be some huge problem with my work that I won’t spot because I’m not intelligent enough etc. I then worry I’ll get fired from my job. 

I think this is all kind of linked to the OCD. The perfectionism, the meticulous checking like I just can’t let go. I’ve always struggled with these things, but the imposter’s syndrome has never been as bad as this. I dread getting up and going to work now, whereas I never used to mind it. 

I’ve spoken to my boss about the struggles a little, but I’m so ashamed of myself and don’t want to admit how hard I’m finding it. 

Does anyone relate to this? Any tips on making it more bearable? I’m feeling really useless at the moment :(

3399,"This is my first time posting here.
I, 34M, am highly doubting my work competences.
I’ve been reading about imposter and think this is what I have.

Let me give background. I come from a family of High intellectual potentials. Although never tested, both my sisters are diagnosed.
I am very sensitive to the opinion of others.

In school, I always succeeded with little effort. I never hid that I did not work and got many jealousy as a result. So I hid my grades.
In university, I got great grades while my gf, now wife, had a harder time, although we studied the same. (She made the schedule).

I’m quite sure I wouldn’t have gotten my degree without her planning.

After my master, I did a PhD, got praise from the jury. But if you ask me, I’ll tell you my research wasn’t worth it, it contributed 0 to science and only got published because my supervisor was good at writing.

I did a Postdoc but then completely changed field.
I felt inadequate in that job, that I wasn’t properly qualified for it.
During my postdoc, I passed a teacher certification, which was easy. 
I couldn’t continue the classes, so I ended up going straight for the jury and received the certification, thanks to my good memories from the previous year lesson.

I did not start working as a teacher, I did something completely different still.
I’ve been doing that job for 3 years. I started mid 2019 and we soon had Covid. I have been unable to resume “as before”. I feel like nothing I do makes a difference so I avoid doing. I’m failing this job and my boss will soon figure it out. Although so far no one said I was doing an inappropriate job.

I then requested to change position in August. And am transitioning positions currently.

Todays, had a progress meeting and was only told I need to make sure I plan and prioritize better. I know this is a weakness I have. I’m too « hot », in the moment.

I procrastinate until last minute and then rush to finish. Mostly because tasks seem impossible. And am not happy because the result is not exactly as I imagined it.

Now I’m lost.
Is it imposter, am I just incompetent, am I really not organized enough, am I just too perfectionist?
I feel like I’m exaggerating thinking it’s imposter.

I’m thinking of seeking help, but first, how do you tell your wife you feel like a failure undeserving of your position?

3402,"Lost the dream job few weeks after starting it and the ideal partner for me, both within a week.

It was first postdoctoral position after finishing PhD. I got ADHD diagnosis at 36yo soon after it all went down. In hindsight I see imposter syndrome as an important part of breakdowns. It dented my confidence so much my former employer mentioned it even in termination notice as one of the main reasons for this decision. Naturally, during PhD impostor syndrome was there at all times. Main ""reasoning"" why I'm going to be fired were common ADHD symptoms: forgetting, chaos, lack of planning skills etc. I covered it all by working much more than my peers, hence I felt I don't belong since others didn't have to work that hard to be there. 

Edit: As for my partner, I couldn't take that she offers me a significant help to tackle the issue with the job, so I moved out from her. Yes, I loved her (still do) more than anything, but the impostor feeling of messing up her life because I'm a failure was just too hard to take, so I packed up my shit and left her place.  Naturally we had a conversation about it but my decision was final. I couldn't just live there anymore.

3405,"TL;DR: I landed an internship at the highest ranked law firm in my country bc I’m skilled at taking exams, not because I’m super smart. Also, my writing skills aren’t great. I feel like such an impostor and like I’m going to fail before everyone’s eyes/get a bad internship-report/grade after my internship ends. Any advice? - Not necessarily looking for life changing solutions (although welcome!), but any advice/tips/words of encouragement or other opinions are appreciated :) 

*edit: the ‘highest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it’s one of the reasons why I don’t belong there

—-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I’ve been more insecure than ever lately & I’m having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‘ranked’ #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don’t always say everything - but let’s just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it’s because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‘honors/cum laude’ grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I’m not trying to say I’m absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I’m not actually super talented, I’m just good at ‘taking exams’ + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I’m neurodivergent and am quite ‘slow’ in understanding things (even if it’s something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren’t so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‘grade’ I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I’m a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

At work I have managed to be relatively successful, but all my career I have had a background minimum, and then full anxiety while I’m in a meeting or working on a project that I somehow scammed my way here and I’m waiting for someone to call me out. My peers and boss have told me that I just lack confidence, but I feel as if it’s deeper. I have learned over the years to just beat back the feeling or how to stay quiet and nod kind of thing. I try self actualization and try and boost myself all the time. I try to brush it off thinking that it doesn’t matter. 

My personal life I worry that my friends just put up with me. I worry that I’m just a bother to people. I worry I’m weird. They tell me I’m a great guy, and that I’m fun. Just like my work I try all the tricks and they work to a point. But my mind never stops. I can only escape in media. A book, a movie, tv, games, etc. anything to forget myself. 

My wife. God I love her. I would do anything for her. But I worry she married me because I was the safe bet, or because I made good money. Nothing nefarious mind you, but again I worry the next thing I say she might laugh or even get mad at me. She has never been that way towards me, it still it’s there…

Not to say there's anything wrong with being average, I don't mind it,  but,  well,  yeah, I'm average. Yet everyone insists I'm not. It's gotten to the point where I assume that it's because of my disability.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends. I just feel ashamed when people with so many accolades Call ME smart or talented.

3425,"I'm a wedding photographer in the UK and have done it since around 2014. I started by doing a few friends weddings and it grew from there to where I now have almost 50 weddings a year.  

I used to really enjoy the job and my work but the more I do it, the faker I feel and the more I worry. I feel that I've marketed myself really well rather than people booking me for my work itself. I feel that I have a fairly realistic idea of how good I am at wedding photography and while I wouldn't put myself at the very bottom, I know I have a long way to go before I would ever like my own work.   

A couple who live in Canada found my Instagram and have booked me for their wedding in France which is happening in a weeks time. I have never felt more like a fraud in my entire life. The pressure is huge. They are paying me to go to France to take their wedding photos. This is now no longer that I just happen to be a local wedding photographer who knows a local venue well.... this is now a case where someone has found me and could have picked anyone in the entire UK or most of Europe! Why me? My work really isn't that good! It's average at best. I rarely even post on Instagram so I don't even know how they came across my page.   

The pressure of photographing their wedding and delivering their images is now weighing so heavy on my shoulders. I'm already going through a mental battle right now with medical testing for what could be a serious life-threatening disease. The added pressure of now having to go to France next week to photograph a wedding is huge.    

I don't even get much feedback from couples anymore either. I used to send off the photos and they would email me back telling me how much they love their photos and then would write a review. I've not had that much recently. I send the photos off and hear absolutely nothing from them ever again. So naturally I ruminate and think that they dislike their images. I keep wondering if I'm doing something different than I used to or if I've become complacent but I'm not so sure. I put in so much effort on my wedding days.

3432,"I battled a brain tumor called a vestibular schwannoma all of last year. It hurt. I was in so much pain, feeling so dizzy like a mix of a bad hangover and the stomach virus. I'd feel intensely weak, confused, and haunted by a vicious ringing in my ear. It was like hearing a bagpipe or teakettle going off in my ears 24/7, while the other symptoms happened EVERYDAY for hours on end, to barying degrees. The vertigo was also terrible. Sometimes I'd fall over. Sometimes I'd have a panic attack while going through it. Sometimes it'd last for hours. It would even keep me from sleeping. Then there are the dangerous situations I was put in because of the loss of balance and loss of hearing 

Due to the COVID pandemic, it was t easy to seek professional medical care. Doctors would make me wait months or even into the next year which I outright refused. I took my own data on my symptoms, my medication, my food, ans the time of day these symptoms happened, all to give insight and remove any extraneous variables as to what was happening. The ER doctors couldnt help me as they didn't find a brain tumor on the CT scan. It wasn't until I got an MRI two months later while going through all of this, that the WNT diagnosed the brain tumor. Not to mention the severe hearing loss in both ears, especially the left.

I saw the best in others and I saw the worst. My mental health suffered while waiting for care. And worst of all the doctors were somewhat dismissive of my needs. It wasn't until I saw a doctor at Duke University Medical Center, one of the most advanced medical centers in the world for skull base tumors, even able to perform operations no other medical center can, that I got real help.

A Vestibular Achwannoma has a high survival rate. Mine wasn't that big at 7mm ans some survive even larger. 

I talk a lot about it on my GoFundMe my friends made, where I post updates and on social media as well.

And yet, a part of me feels like maybe it wasn't that bad. I didn't die. I didn't end up like the others who are worse off than I am today. I felt I was dying and was even suicidal, thinking and plotting ways to off myself that would be considered an accident. I didn't want to live life with the amount of hearing loss I had, the potential for permanent dizziness, ans these tormenting symptoms to continue even after surgery (which the symptoms have since resolved sans the hearing loss).

Maybe I'm a whiner. Maybe I'm not simply updating friends and gsmiyl, but looking for attention. Maybe I shouldn't have spent my GoFundMe donations on more than just medical bills - like a dietician, additional physical therapy, and yoga lessons. All were to help me adjust to life after a brain tumor and improve my almost non-existent balance. But it wasn't specifically necessary, even if it worked.

I know what I went through was real, and nobody else's opinion on the matter has any meaning but mine. Even now, I still talk to a therapist who I've seem throughout this process. She says this is normal for many, these feelings. What I went through was real. Did someone doubt me? Yep, but nobody else sided with those people.

My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.

I was in a really competitive high school a few years back, and actually managed to get great grades but was seen as the “smart kid” and my friends and teachers judged me a lot if I wasn’t getting into a prestigious program or school or if I did less well on tests which we had every week, and my mental health was really bad as a result. A lot of my friends had really toxic or abusive relationships (platonic romantic familial) and always leveraged off success as their defining “I’m doing better” kind of moment, and it compelled me to do the same even though it was destroying me. Fast forward and I’ve graduated a long time ago and no longer talk to anyone there. 

I’ve noticed that my imposter syndrome has gotten so bad and ironically manifests in little white lies. For example, I’ve been telling people that I got into X university when they ask but decided not to go; but the truth is I didn’t even apply there. I hate how easily little lies like this slip out of my mouth even when meeting new people when they ask, and I really want to stop even though these lies have no effect on serious aspects of my life :( yesterday I met someone new and this slipped out yet again, and it just bothers me so much. 

I go to a great college now that I worked my ass off to get into, but I feel like a Personality Imposter if that makes sense, and I’m surrounded by all these super talented people who are really passionate and collaborative and the brightest people in their countries etc. it really sucks that I simultaneously want to celebrate my successes which I know are valid but it feels like my whole life they were nothing compared to others.

3439,"Hi everyone,
So I started a new job about 7 weeks ago, it is a complete change of scenery and a male dominated industry but I do enjoy it.
My ex helped me with getting an interview as he knew the SSM who hires the employees.
I still went through the application and interview process but it was definitely more lenient for me.
And although I feel like I have proved myself capable and that I want to pursue a higher career in this industry, I still can’t help but think because I had help that I do not deserve it.

I have also found out my colleagues have sent a recommendation email to the SSM about me, which helps.
But the doubt is always there, plus my ex has now started using it against me in certain situations.

Curious as to how others deal with this or if it’s just a time thing waiting to feel like I’m apart of the company because I deserve to be not because I had a helping hand at the start.",anticipation
3440,"Hi everyone - just want to vent about my life since I have no one to talk to.

I started a new job and when I joined, I had no idea that a similar counterpart for my role was also hired. “Marisa” joined a month after me in the same role. 

I was already blindsided and confused as to what I would be doing since they hired someone else for my exact role.

Overtime, we’ve gotten to known each other and I think very highly of her and actually very envious of how she talks and her experiences. She seems so smart when she talks, and always has something to say in meetings to contribute. Our executive team really likes her as well. She is just really good at her job. She also does way more than me so I feel like I am not doing anything.

Whenever I talk, I feel so stupid. I don’t sound smart. I say “yeah” and “ok” a lot. I know I’m very introverted - I don’t know why I started such an extrovert-type role. Whenever I contribute an idea, everyone shuts me down. Even our manager that we both report to sides with her all the time and mentions that them two are a team and never says anything about me as part of the team.

I just feel so stupid and feel like I don’t know anything and everyone else thinks I am stupid too. I am feeling such a heavy bout of imposter syndrome. I know I have good experiences and got hired for a reason but I cannot express myself the way I want to. I want to seem confident and talk a lot - but I don’t know what to say.

3442,"So this was a cultural event and the prep, auditions, everything started sometime in late December. Ofc, i battled my anxiety and attended the first meet somehow, and few auditions but never could muster up the courage to just go for it.

After 4 months, everybody who participated have become so close (and active on the group). Last two days I volunteered too, but then too I felt so out of place. Regardless of the welcoming people. 

And today, there were more volunteers and we had fun too. But then, there was this empty feeling once it wrapped up. Everybody who participated and well, involved in the process were sooo enterwined with each other and I was just... there. Trying to find my foot. BUT EVERYBODY APPRECIATED US. Tomorrow is the after party, and my teammate was like, ""we are sooo going!!!! After all we worked so hard"" and in my head, I was like, ""did we?"" UGH 😫😫😫😫


I HATE FEELING THIS WAY.

And oh, by the way suddenly I am feeling insecure about my age too. I feel so old and less accomplished. I feel so lost. I haven't felt this way in few years.

3443,"Hi community. My first post in this community and I am curious about how Imposter Syndrome shows not only in your life but also specifically in relationships. 

About me: I am 37, almost 38, first and foremost a musician who has struggled with performance anxiety and always trying to give my best but then always end up thinking it wasn’t good enough, or that there’s someone better than me. Add in having parents who constantly asked why I wasn’t doing well in college and subsequently thinking they are always judging my every move in life. 

But I think most notably I struggle with my Imposter Syndrome surfacing in my relationships. I am gay and have had a couple significant relationships in my life, my last one being 7 years with someone who I viewed as more successful than me, smarter, etc. I am now entering a new relationship with a very creative person (who has admitted his own struggles with Imposter) but who has that ability to be confident, and show his self so strongly. As this relationship is going I find myself thinking thoughts that tear down every facet of hope in this relationship. And I am madly and deeply in love more and more every day.  Like, “what does this guy want with you, you don’t talk strong like he does, you don’t have strong opinions, you’re not good enough for him, if he really gets to know you he won’t like you, one day he will meet someone else that is better than you” 

I guess I’m looking for ways to cope, to live with this because I don’t think it will ever go away, to survive, to keep going, to love and be free to accept love. Thanks for listening.",trust

3447,"This is my first post here. I'm sorry if I break any rules.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone. Even though I know that I suffer from imposter syndrome, (I'm in therapy for this and other reasons), I TRUELY believe that what I'm doing is bad and that I am stupid. People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

Update: I handed it in last week!! The only thought that kept me going was ""It doesn't matter if it's bad. Just finish it somehow."" I couldn't convince myself that what I doing was good.

3452,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I’m in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

“You went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.”  
“You’ve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won’t make enough because of it to make that ok”

“Your almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??”

It’s the answer to the last one that makes me realize I’ve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I’ve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I’m a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn’t know I just couldn’t hack it academically, even though I’ve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn’t worked, it’s because those around me wouldn’t let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fiancé before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn’t let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream “who cares” and snap everyone around me out of it.

I know grades aren’t a indicator of anything but my friends try to tell me I’m smart because I get good grades, but that is only because I spend so much time studying, and anyone would be able to get the grade if they studied that much. My question is, what if I’m actually just stupid compared to others and I’m just good at giving off the impression of being “smart” but they don’t truly know how inefficient my brain works?

I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

I’m so glad to find this sub. I’m a new graduate, I just graduated in October.

I found a remote part time job on contract that I have until this april and took it so I’d have something to do while I look for full time. My father passed away in September and I didn’t actively look for a while before or after.

Now, after a couple months of very consistent applying for probably hundreds of jobs and 3 interviews- I got a full time permanent job offer at a GREAT company, in my field too. Excellent entry level opportunity. My mom is over the moon and so are family and friends BUT.. 

The position is set to start in July and every single day I feel like I will lose it before even starting it. That I will receive an email one random day and they just take it back for no reason. My mom wanted to celebrate with friends and I refuse to. I feel like I would just have to inform everyone that I lost it. 

I don’t feel like I could possibly get an opportunity this good. Why would they pick me? Undoubtedly I have peers that are just as smart if not smarter. They obviously will realise that before July or something totally improbable like the position just being eliminated from the organisation.

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It’s hard to tell internally whether you’re funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You’re not a good judge of that. You’re on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people’s actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it’s so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn’t be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There’s no downside. Even if you don’t “need” it or supposedly don’t “deserve” it, it doesn’t matter, because it’s a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you’ll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don’t know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I’ll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I’ve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I’ve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there’s a more tangible motivator- ‘I really want to have a good day, and it’s statistically much more likely if I’m productive.’ Try it if you’d like. Idk. I didn’t keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain’t real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it’s happening, that’s a fantastic help. It’s even better when/if you’re able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I’m rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you’ll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful. ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

3481,"Hi All,

Let me start by saying I believe I've had imposter syndrome for as long as I can remember (going back to elementary school and believing I was not at the same level as my school peers).

&#x200B;

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job. I've been working on my resume (obsessing mostly), trying to perfect it, sell myself as best I can without over-selling. My father says I need to just start applying but I am just so anxious that any job I get with some responsibility, I'll end up failing.

&#x200B;

I do suffer from anxiety and OCD, so I'm basically always already doubting myself. The thing is, through experience, I tend to overthink situations. I have for as long as I can remember. But in the end, things that I've overthought tend to not be as scary as I've made them in my mind.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

&#x200B;

It feels rather hopeless :(",anticipation
3482,"Hello all:

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others. I have hesitated to share my thoughts here for fear of being insensitive to others that need more assistance. I appologize in advance if I offend anyone, know that I didnt have malicious intentions. A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

I would appreciate any perspectives. Even critical negitive ones will help me see if my problem is important or not, even though I understand it is something many go through.

Once again, I hope I haven't offended anyone, I promise I had no ill intentions.",trust
3483,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",trust

3485,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them. Sorry this is so long, most of you probably won't even get to the end but my point is: is the way I felt about being called a hero imposter syndrome?",trust

Composing music started out fun, Until I learned a bit of music theory and started to hear my creations closer and realized their were all mediocre and not worthy to be listened to, Or at least, That's what I've been telling myself.

Now it's gotten to the point where i'm being suggested to collaborate with another composer, which I can't do because of my Social anxiety. Not to mention I have severe trust issues.

This directive made me incredibly stressed especially since I haven’t seen anything or identified any projects since she’s told me that. I feel like it’s because I’m being lazy or not smart enough to identify those situations.

3493,"2 daily examples of imposter syndrome: 

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly. Sometimes if I have a backup or another I feel more comfortable using it. What made me realize it is my laptop, the surface pro 3 I got 5 years ago I've always felt weird using it, but now that I was just given the pro 7 for Christmas I feel way more comfortable using the old one because I know if it breaks I'll have another chance. (poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

Also last night going to bed I had the thought, ""I can't believe I'm not homeless"". A huge part of my imposter syndrome rn is being mostly financially dependent on my mom and not having financial independence yet.

When I was young I used to copy my friends hair styles, call their favourite colours my favourite colours and basically try and adopt the habits, interests or styles of people I admired.

Someone's I'm scared that I'm still doing this unintentionally and it takes a bit of the enjoyment out of things.

For example: My friend, Dylan, really likes unsettling and weird art videos. Like Jack Stauber or u m a m i. Before we became friends I used to just skip past these kinds of things. I was pretty indifferent towards them. But after a conversation that I had with Dylan about them, I love them. Feel almost that I have no right liking them. And that I'm doing the same thing that I used to do as a child. It makes me feel really embarrassed and ashamed and I'm constantly having to try and convince myself that Dylan's own love of these videos simply inspired mine and that Im not being pretentious.

3521,"I've been having some serious doubts in my ability to code in a professional environment. I've been going through Colt Steele's Fullstack Web Developer course on Udemy. I sit down to start designing my portfolio and then good ole Mr.IS creeps in the back of my mind telling me ""no business would want my coding skills, psshhh skills you can't even code"" there have been moments I've just sat at my keyboard and cried because it's such a hard thing to wrestle with. 

Recently I've been fighting a wrongful termination with FedEx Ground. During my paid suspension I really hit that course hard working everyday on it. I was so excited when I made a very rudimentary To-Do list out of Html, CSS and JavaScript considering it was really my first time using JavaScript to create something. I go look at others portfolios for kind of the Do's and Don'ts. I see their portfolio and the projects they have and instantly start questioning if I'm really cut out for this. My wife u/mrsjamiel has been nothing but supportive and wanting me to finish this course but I'm just having a hard time of grappling with the imposter syndrome. 


The other thing that's causing this is, I finished the Frontend Web Developer section of the course. So now I'm doing backend. It's just alot because now it's more routing pages, server side code with Node.js GET PULL PUSH REQUEST REQUIRE RESPOND etc and it's like am I in way over my head? Can I really do a Fullstack app. Do I even deserve to call myself a Jr. Fullstack Engineer


To give another point, when I was at work one morning because we live in Phoenix it got extremely hot in the warehouse and moving packages from trailer to trailer takes a bit out of you. I told the manager I need a minute because it's just hot. He told me to go home because he didn't want me passing out on the dock.

I’ve been a professional musician for 5 years now. In terms of performing, I have worked past my feelings of feeling inadequate. At this point it’s audio engineering and teaching that are a struggle for me.

As a teacher I’ve been teaching online since 2018. I have nothing but 5 star reviews, but I feel like I don’t have enough for my students. I went to school for music and think I’m reasonably well trained, but I have this anxiety that with each student at some point I’m going to run out of helpful things to tell them and I’ll just be getting paid to sit with them while they practice. I often get nervous during my lessons that students feel I’m wasting their time, but they come back from week to week. 

As an audio engineer I also started in 2018. I did not have a ton of experience, so I charged a small fee and did the best I could. I did NOT go to school to become an audio engineer, but decided to do it after college. I’ve took an intensive course helping me to feel more confident in my tracking, editing, and mixing abilities, as well as joining an online cohort for 6 months to get feedback on my work. I’ve put in time and I’ve had the opportunity to work with some great clients... but I am going to be working with a group signed to Warner Bros. and I just feel like I’m not worthy. I forced myself to take the opportunity, but I am really nervous about it. I am also working on an album for a vocal band right now and feel like I’m not doing them justice, despite saying they’re loving the product thus far. 

I try not to let my feelings of being a fraud interfere with my life and the business I’ve built for myself... and I try to push myself to take opportunities even if I’m not comfortable with it...  but I know in my heart of hearts that my feelings are affecting my ability to do my best work and have periodically paralyzed me with fear.

3529,"I (25F) literally got my Masters in Industrial Engineering 2 weeks ago. I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from 3 years ago, but I was never good at the major to land a job. Given my recent accomplishment, I'd be impressed with myself if I didn't feel aimless. (Don't get a graduation either. So I wonder if it even matters.)

Most of the jobs I've applied for I've either been rejected from or haven't heard anything in weeks. Or I'm just not qualified because I don't have experience. Or I don't have the security clearance for them. 

I'm fortunate to have a part-time job, but no upward mobility as my division isn't hiring. Come to find out today that some other guy in another division just got his Master's at the same time and was hired full-time this Tuesday. I just feel embarrassed and really discouraged. 

I feel like I'm fuming. Like I'm Lisa Simpson begging for attention or encouragement after not being at school for a week.

3532,"My tutoring company has been doing remote work due to COVID, and they are starting to look into some in-person tutoring, given that both the client and tutor are comfortable. I have the option of being an in-person tutor again, in which I get paid a little more. I'm not personally scared of COVID from tutoring, so I am considering it. I worry though about being a good enough tutor. And so far the two students I've had who switched tutors—I'm assuming because they didn't like me—were ones I went to see in person, as opposed to in the office or remote. 

If I may vent, I was academically successful until college, at which point, I got by. I mean, I went to a prestigious STEM school and graduated in good standing with a BS in CS-Math. I think I got honors in CS. And I love helping people, tutored on-campus, and even tutored young kids over the phone. So I'm capable.

However, I'm not confident. And I don't do well under pressure. Like once I was doing an interview, I was asked to calculate the value of 5/8 without a calculator. I said 1.6 or something. At which point, the interviewer guided me to the realization that 5/8 is less than 1, so how is 1.6 reasonable?

I've had my tutoring job for less than a year. But I have been in it for over half a year, so I think I'm past the ""oh, you're new, mistakes happen"" phase. I believe I have the foundational knowledge I need, but I don't think I have the... sufficient knowledge that other tutors seem to have to confidently answer any kid's question. I find myself often saying that I need to get back to a kid on that. I don't know all the answers, despite having resources, answer keys, and time to plan. Nor am I motivated to give even more time to learning as I have already. 

So I feel like an imposter. Either because I am less competent than my fellow tutors or because I don't want to put in the effort I'd need to be as competent as them. 

Yesterday, I had one remote lesson to teach in the evening. All day I'd been anxious about it. It wasn't horrible anxiety, but it was present. And the lesson was fine. I expected it to be fine. But I still felt scared. 

I feel like an imposter. And I don't like it. But this tutoring job is so flexible and has such a respectful community, that I don't think I should give it up. If something feels wrong, I figure I must be at fault. 

tl;dr I do feel like an imposter. I think I just wanted to vent. If anyone has advice, that'd be cool, too.",trust

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent.

One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it.

3543,"I am new to this sub but I wanted to throw a suggestion out. One of the pieces of advice I received about managing imposter syndrome was to keep a running list of positive feedback, accomplishments (big or small), successes, and compliments to reflect on and help to combat feelings of incompetence and not belonging.  

I wonder if folks on here would find any value in having a weekly thread where everyone could just comment with their weekly successes, accomplishments, or positive feedback received. I was thinking there would be no expectation about what success (etc.) means. Someone could write that they remembered to water the plants this week or they got a B on a paper or someone complimented the way they drafted that email or they felt like they might look dumb but they mustered the courage to ask that question in class anyway. The central idea being that it might help us remind ourselves that we do have skill, we are competent, we do belong. It could be a way for us to support one another as well. 

One potential downside I could see is that if folks are listing their successes it might make someone feel more like an imposter if they don't feel like they have something to contribute. Or with the process of upvoting someone might feel bad because they only got 2 but someone else got 10. But my hope would be that we could all support each other in whatever successes people post whether it seem small or large. If folks are interested we could assess how it's going after a few weeks or so and make sure it's helpful, not harmful.

3545,"Hi all,

I'm here to share my story and wondering if anyone has any advice... a long post ahead (apologies).

I moved to a new country in mid 2018 with a job in a field I wanted to be in.

Prior to my move overseas, I was doing pretty ok at my job and enjoyed it well enough to keep going everyday.  I entered into the field as a graduate and did pretty well there. My job involves analytical thinking and using numbers on a daily basis. At school, math has never been my forte and I've always felt a sense of anxiety towards it for a number of reasons (e.g shamed in front of peers, parental pressure etc.). However, when I moved overseas and got a job in the same field, things started to go downhill.

The overseas job was fundamentally similar to what I was previously doing, but much more complex and customised work. I was making errors and mistakes on basic stuff. My anxiety increased exponentially and everyday I felt like I was going to be revealed as someone who is incompetent. I did my very best and worked really hard to double, triple check my work but it was a cycle of stress and anxiety as I felt less confident and would catastrophize every situation in my head (e.g. I'm going to get fired then get deported...) Coupled with the fact that my boss was a grammar nazi and had really strong eye for detail... I lasted a year and a half before I was let go.  Self sabotage much!

(I also have to note that my errors never led to any projects fallen apart, nor did we loose any clients over my work. It was the small things that added up to the whole.)

It was a tough time because I felt like an absolute failure. My boss and my colleagues had finally discovered the ""truth"" about me...

I've been lucky to get a job relatively quickly since then as I was already looking for other roles before I was let go, but feel like the situation could end up similarly if I don't change and overcome this ASAP. I've already found myself making a few simple errors and this has triggered some anxiety again.

I'm working through some parts of it through a therapist (there's a host of other issues relating to self confidence and childhood trauma which are all connected), but not sure if I can financially sustain it in the long run.

There are a few things I have been working on to try and manage and stay in control.  For example, I'm actively trying to improve my mathematical ability regularly, keep a check list of 'must-dos', exercising regularly to manage my thoughts. Since going into the new job I've tried my best do things differently to what I did before even on simple tasks. I've told my self that it's my 'system of working' that's not working - not a fundamental judgement of my ability and self.

What I do enjoy about the job is that it gives me experience to work on interesting projects and have an impact.

My plan is to stay for a minimum of one year in this new role while I try to find something else.  At the end, perhaps I'm just not suited to this job... Or am I just having a hard time letting go? Am I really an imposter?

Any thoughts or advice to manage all of this? :) It would be really welcomed and appreciated!",trust
3547,"Hi all, I am amazed that this subreddit exists! I hope everyone is staying sane during the crisis.  

I am a medical student in the US and imposter syndrome hit me hard when I first started medical school - someone people have told me that it never really goes away so I should just find a way to deal with it through various wellness practices. 

While I still feel it now, a couple years ago I was overworking myself to the point where I was not eating all day until 8-9PM, not taking breaks, and not being social so I wanted to write a post for anyone who can relate to my experience. It took me a long time to acknowledge that I have imposter syndrome and that's totally okay, but because I realized that now I try as much as I can to not let it dictate my life.

Or if both are in the same field and in the same office (say, both are programmers and work on the same project, they check each other's codes occasionally). One is honest and gives good review, the other degrades the other persons coding skills (even if they are obviously on the same level) and eventually the downgraded person will start believing that they're really not good enough.

I wonder if this is impostor by proxy or something else like gaslighting? Maybe it's gas lighting but the result, impostor syndrome, is the same. But it fo.es by a proxy bot by themselves even if it then continues to com from themselves... is this even coherent? Do I make sense?

3574,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr. I learned recently that she consistently tops their exams, amidst her peers who, like me, finished from top universities. I can't help but feel that this only reinforces my own imposter syndrome. If my friend who went to the same unknown university as I did, performed as well as me, even getting the exact same honor and exact same score in the medical admission test I did, yet she's performing spectacularly in med school whereas I'm now below average, then it only means I really did just luck out on my achievements so far.

3578,"What's the psychology behind Imposter Syndrome?

If I were to reply that question based on my experience with imposter syndrome, I'll say it's because I expect people to acknowledge my capabilities the way I imagine I'd have done it to someone else. But how often do I compliment someone else irl? It's quite rare that I pat on a friend or a relative's back to celebrate their accomplishments. This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.

I feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions. This is why this sort of compliments feel diluted like it's not meaningful enough to digest as truthful.

However, in real life, I work as a software developer and whenever my boss or the seniors compliment me (which rarely happens) on something I did, suddenly all of that worries instantly go away but unfortunately, it's only temporary. I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.

A potential cure?

I think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us. For me, those people are my parents, my brother, my boss, the seniors at work and a couple of colleagues in my rank. I believe that if one wants their imposter syndrome to completely go away, they're gonna have to maximise the amount of compliments they want to generate from these meaningful people. The compliment may not be physically expressed but it could also be subtle as in an increase in the respect people have for you.

In order to please those people, you're gonna have to 'git gud' in life. Work on yourself constantly, keep improving yourself. Always be active. Always ask for something to do. Try to work on the bank of knowledge of your department if you work in software. During my spare time, not only do I browse Reddit but I have tabs of research materials open. I gather knowledge which my team will need in the future and I present them during meeting.

Work your way up the hierarchy of competence and you'll notice your imposter syndrome will slowly fade away. The way people will look at you will be different. They will smile at you. They will be happy to work with you and to me, that's the one effective way to combat against that horrible, horrible thing called imposter syndrome. Get GOOD!",trust

I'm pretty close currently - I'm a creative lead for an agency that does work for transportation clients, which can include the govt. I like the overall atmosphere but...

I've been here for 3 months now. The first big project I've had is a branding project for an organization's program. We presented concepts to the client and while they didn't completely freak out and call it OMGZ AMAZING, they were still really well received and they liked it. 

My supervisor doesn't feel it's enough. She wants them to basically freak out with joy when they see our work, because that's what they've done in the past.

I feel pretty defeated/rejected/unworthy at this point - everything I've tried working for in this field just feels like it's been for nothing, and at this point I don't know what I'm doing being a creative anymore. I'm not good enough. 

The reason this hits me so hard is because overall I have had a hard time keeping a job for the same exact reason - I've never been enough for a company. I don't know what I can do anymore. I have never felt like I am good enough in this field, but it's the only thing I know.

3596,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn’t put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn’t. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family’s and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if’s. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it’s why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I’ve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what’s looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don’t look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it’s offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don’t have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We’ll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don’t feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don’t treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven’t earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn’t earn it, that’s bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that’s where you go so ride it out. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don’t go down the dark hole there’s nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

A little about me: I started a new job about 3 months ago. I love it! I feel like I'm being challenged and a part of something awesome. Love my boss and coworkers. The problem is that I have realized how little I actually know and how often it causes me to fuck up at work. I feel like every other day my manager is confronting me about yet another mistake. 

It kind of came to a head on Monday when I not only screwed up a 2 week project, but I mishandled a piece of Very Expensive machinery. My boss told me that people have been fired for a similar mistake and next time I WILL lose my job. 

I have an advanced degree but I feel like an absolute bonehead. I know we all make mistakes, but I honestly I don't know why I haven't been fired yet. I also have anxiety which doesn't help... but man it feels like I'm not cut out for this.

3601,"I'm a 16 year old high school student in Arizona, about to enter my senior year, and I feel so far behind my peers. I feel I'm way too hard on myself, as I currently work a job and I'm ranked #5 in weighted GPA at my high school with a 4.209. That should be enough, right? Although I've tried to tell myself that I've done enough already, I couldn't feel more like a fraud. There are so many points that I could consider when telling myself I am who everyone thinks I am, but my mind comes up with very convincing counterpoints. For example, I achieved the highest ACT score of my class, where it was mandatory for all juniors to take the ACT, yet it was just a 31. Considering a 31 is the BEST ACT score IN THE JUNIOR CLASS, it makes me feel like I'm going to a school of very low academic achievement. This leads into my next point. I was just elected the president of my school's National Honors Society, but I don't feel I deserve it. The members are all extremely lazy, but I hope that changes in Senior year. I have quite a few ideas for improvements we can make to the club next year, but the running was a complete joke. In fact, I was the only student to even run for president, and I've only ever been to one event we held as a club (We''ve only ever had around 4. It was a super bad year for us.) and I hadn't even been to all of the meetings. On top of this, my SAT score is a little disappointing to me. I got a 1410. And I really don't mean for this to sound like a troll post, this is just what my brain keeps telling me. And I understand that in writing this sounds ridiculous, but it's just so rough. I wish I had done more extracurriculars while I could. I haven't done a single sport or other club save NHS and a few days of robotics club at the end of Junior year. This problem really has me considering my future, and fearing I'm going to be a failure. I feel like my GPA means nothing, especially being from one of the lowest ranked states as far as academics go. This is really just a vent post, as I understand it may sound ridiculous, but I just feel like I don't deserve any of the stuff I have, like I've just been really lucky to get good test scores but in reality I'm super unintelligent.

3602,"I’m so beyond grateful for the support of my family, friends, and boyfriend and their words of congratulations to me. A small part of me thinks “yeah I did that, I accomplished it,” but the bigger part of me doesn’t know why I feel nothing.

My time as a piano major was extremely stressful, not in the academic way but in a personal way that was tied to my professors. After graduating from my two year college, my private instructor there cut me off completely. It was confusing because we were so close, she was someone I told everything to. My last conversation with her, I revealed to her that my sister was taken by CPS and I was diagnosed with RA. I tried to follow up with her but she never responded. I don’t resent her for it, I’m still very confused and hurt that after 2-3 years of talking to her almost everyday, she refused to say hello or even ask how I was doing after transferring to university.

Almost immediately after moving away from family to continue my studies, I learned about my sister and CPS and it impacted my ability to focus or perform, which is huge since I was literally a performance major and I was performing every week. I thought I had gained trust with one of my piano professors, so I told him what was going on. He was so supportive until my last day of class when he told me how disappointed he was in my final class performance but that he would still give me an A out of pity for me. That should’ve made me feel grateful but I felt so humiliated. In my last year at university, my new private lesson instructor made me feel like I had learned nothing while at school, saying I wouldn’t pass my recital hearing (basically a test to see if I’m ready to perform my senior recital) and even threatening my graduation date. He would also say things like “you haven’t made any progress” but in the same breath tell me I’ve come a long way, which confused me. Small things like that added up to an entire list, most of which is made up of negative commentary.

Now I’m not going to pretend like I deserve only praise. I’m well aware that I’m not a prodigy and that I’m not going to make a career out of performing because it’s not something I feel I have the constitution for. Sure, I enjoy the occasional performance especially in front of audiences that are supportive and want to hear what I have to share. I actually just had my debut in Colombia in April where I got to teach a masterclass and then perform in the concert hall in front of 500 people. They were so incredibly kind and they are still reaching out to me to tell me how much they loved hearing me play.

So why, after seeing my own progress and being happy with how I progressed, especially as someone in a field where there are so many incredible and inspiring musicians, do I feel like I didn’t do what I was supposed to? I used to be so proud of the music I shared because I genuinely felt like I was meant to do this, but then hearing these professors who used to attend Juilliard and Curtis and had well-established careers that I’m a disappointment made me feel like no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be worthy of praise. And now that I have my degree, all I can think about is the pain associated with my years at college. That I may have improved slightly but in the long run, it doesn’t matter.",trust

The reason this kind of gives me imposter syndrome is because my last name starts with a letter that’s at the start of the alphabet.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

Due to my grades I thought it would be difficult for me to find a job, but I quickly got a position as an engineer, and two years later I am still in the same company where I have a position with a high technical profile.

In my day to day I obviously interact with my team, where at the level of academic trajectory, I am clearly at the bottom, if not in the last place. It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

After that, I searched and took Imposter Syndrome quizzes online (I know its not reliable but I just want to see how I fair) and turns out that every single one of the quizzes I took said I have a high tendency or possibility of having Imposter Syndrome.

Looking back, I think I identify with the signs of having it. I have been an achiever since I was a kid. I was a consistent Honors Student (Straight As) from Elementary to High School. In college, I did well too. I was consistent Deans List and graduated Cum Laude. I was Managing Editor of our College Newspaper and competed and won regional and national titles in Journalism competitions. 

Went to law school and did fairly well again. Took the bar only once and passed. I was a lawyer before I was 30. 

My whole life I was expected to accomplish high feats. People see me as an achiever. But to be honest, I dont see myself as such. I always think that I might be good but someone will always be better than me. I always think that I should have accomplished more rn at my age but i havent. I feel like all other friends, classmates I had have already come a long way.

I feel like all the accolades and hardwork I did doesnt really make me capable. I dont like talking abt my achievements or being complimented coz I feel embarrassed. I just wanted to be lowkey.

Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong.

My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."".

When you’re self-aware, you have an accurate and clear understanding of your character, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs and sense of self. You know what your life is about, you know how others perceive you and the effect you have on them.

Why does it matter?

Your level of self-awareness influences the key pillars in your life – your relationships, career, personal development and overall wellbeing.

· Self-awareness is necessary for taking control of your life. The direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and reactions. Self-awareness is the principal way of understanding and influencing these things. When you take control, you have choices.

· Self-awareness identifies un-resourceful beliefs and emotional reactions that stand in your way and gives you the power to make adjustments – personal growth.

· Self-awareness can lead to a greater understanding of past setbacks and challenges. We can conveniently dismiss our failures as bad luck or a lack of proper timing. But it’s also possible that we failed to perceive the situation, others, or ourselves accurately. It’s much easier to see the reason behind relationship, work, and other struggles when we can look at ourselves honestly.

· Self-awareness is critical for successful leadership. Leaders with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses are able to build teams that compensate those weaknesses and leverage the strengths.

· Self-awareness is the foundation for personal growth. Without it, any personal development efforts will be severely hampered – as if you’re building on sand.  
   
 

# How Can I Develop Self-Awareness?

· **Develop the habit of Noticing your thoughts.** Our minds are constantly churning through ideas and endlessly providing commentary. Becoming aware of these thoughts, and noticing the common themes gives the potential for encouraging more resourceful self-talk.

○ Notice your thinking patterns. What are you thinking when you’re feeling nervous? Bored? Interested? Walking down the street? – what does this mean for you?

○ Do you judge people and situations? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future? Do you expect the worst to happen or the best? Or do you adopt an open attitude of, “Let’s just see what happens”?

· **Notice your feelings.** What are you feeling throughout the day? What do you feel while you’re eating? Driving to work? Lying in bed? Waiting in line?

○ As you notice each emotion, question it. What am I feeling? Why? What do I need right now? How do I normally react in this situation? Is this resourceful for me? 

· **Reflect on how you deal with frustration or emotional discomfort.** ***A huge chunk of your time is spent trying to make yourself feel better.*** If you feel slightly frustrated or uncomfortable, then you may spend a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to change the situation or the others around you to resolve those negative feelings. Would id be more resourceful to develop your responses – which you can control – or try to change others – who you do not control. 

○ Do you try to control others? Do you attempt to distract yourself? Is your first instinct to leave the situation? Do you surf the internet or eat a big bowl of ice cream?

· **Consider your friendships.** Where do you meet new friends? Are most of your friendships long-term or short? When your friendships end, what is the common cause? What types of people do you prefer to be friends with? What types of people do you avoid?

· **Consider your intimate relationships.** Do you see patterns in the type of people that you’ve been involved with? What are the common positive and negative characteristics they share? Why do you think those people appealed to you?

○ What were your shortcomings in your relationships? Are you clingy? Jealous? Too focused on work? Fail to communicate your needs? Think about how you contributed to the successes and failure of your relationships.

○ Have you changed your approach from relationship to relationship, or do you continue to repeat the same patterns?

· **Keep a journal.** This is a highly effective way to learn about yourself by recording your thoughts, feelings, and experiences each day. Be sure to include your high and low points for the day.

○ Note how well you ate and slept, too. Sleep – especially changes in sleeping patterns - can elicit very valuable information about what is going on. 

○ Create a habit of writing in your journal for at least 15 minutes each day. You’ll start to notice patterns and learn a lot about yourself.

· **Reflect on your core values.** Think about and then document your core values, goals and intentions. You might be surprised by what you write. This is a great first step for understanding yourself and your beliefs.

· **Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses.** How do you know? Are you certain? Avoid jumping to conclusions. You may have always believed that you’re a hard worker, but are you? To whom are you comparing yourself? Provide yourself with proof before you make any decisions. Are you noticing any limiting beliefs – I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy?

· **What would others say about you?** Consider how your partner, children, friends, family, co-workers, and boss would describe you. What would they suggest you improve about yourself? How do you respond to thinking about what others think about you?

· **Trance.** Meditation is all about developing a better awareness of the present moment and yourself. *Meditation is an ideal activity for enhancing self-awareness. Hypnosis / Self-hypnosis is all about using the trance state to support your general wellbeing and specific outcomes.*

○ Meditate at least once each day. Spend the rest of the day paying attention to yourself, others, and your surroundings. You can develop a higher degree of self-awareness by just paying attention.

○ Question yourself throughout the day.  *“What emotions am I currently feeling and why?” “What are the people around me feeling?” ‘’what is the best use of my time right now?’’*",trust

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",trust
3628,"Hi everyone,

I (fairly) recently got promoted at work, and I’ve been really struggling with what I’m assuming is imposter’s syndrome ever since. :( I’m finding it really really hard. 

My job is research based, originally I was doing more admin tasks and I was quite happy and confident in what I was doing. After my promotion I became more directly involved with conducting the research itself. It’s a big change in my role and the day-to-day activities in my job.

When I went for the promotion, I kind of worried this would happen. I’m a people pleaser, I suffer with social anxiety and OCD, so I did think that this might be too much for me, but there was pressure to go for it from colleagues, friends, family etc. I thought getting promoted would look good to others and therefore make me feel better about myself :( 

However now I’m stuck in the job and I’m just really struggling. We have deadlines, so I feel like I’m constantly rushing to finish things. When I rush, I get stressed because the quality of my work isn’t as good as I feel it should be. I worry there are mistakes that I don’t have time to rectify, then I worry that the mistakes mean I’m not good enough to be in this role. I’m also slower because I meticulously check everything for errors, which I worry doesn’t look good for my performance, further proving to myself that I don’t deserve this job. Generally I’m worried my lack of knowledge is going to be revealed somehow, that there will be some huge problem with my work that I won’t spot because I’m not intelligent enough etc. I then worry I’ll get fired from my job. 

I think this is all kind of linked to the OCD. The perfectionism, the meticulous checking like I just can’t let go. I’ve always struggled with these things, but the imposter’s syndrome has never been as bad as this. I dread getting up and going to work now, whereas I never used to mind it. 

I’ve spoken to my boss about the struggles a little, but I’m so ashamed of myself and don’t want to admit how hard I’m finding it. 

Does anyone relate to this? Any tips on making it more bearable? I’m feeling really useless at the moment :( 







I don’t know… I just feel like… everyone else on my team is better than me. They seem to know what they’re doing, whereas I’m just sat doubting everything I do.",trust

I ruin all my free time just obsessing about a work problem and once I’ve solved it in my mind I find another. If I can’t solve the puzzle I will assume that I will lose my job, end up homeless and have to give up my dog. And will never find another job again. If I try to stop the thoughts I still feel physically anxious about them so it’s a constant reminder.
All my obsessive worries never actually have a bad outcome but it’s so hard to rationalise. I feel like I’m ruining my life as have done this for a decade.

3630,"When I was a kid the only thing my mother saw in me was my ""potential"". Despite me not doing well in school she was convinced that I was a genius in the making. She thought school was a waste of time and gave me her blessing to play hooky whenever I felt like it, because for some reason she thought I was a natural genius that ""didn't need to study"". For some reason, despite this, she would still fly into a rage at me whenever my teacher would call to complain that I wasn't doing well in school (idk how or why she could hold these two opposing attitudes at the same time and yet she did). So basically at any given time she was either love bombing me because of my imaginary brilliance, raging at me because of my failures, or neglecting me. So nowadays I have crippling imposter syndrome that makes me see failure in everything I do and ever have done and anticipate it in anything I ever plan on doing - which, in turn, causes me to self sabotage like crazy, and even though I'm aware of it idk how to stop.

3631,"Hello I am new here M (24). I have been a poor student ever since I can remember. I failed 5 grade (who fails 5th grade ffs?). I am not a poor learner or stupid by any means but I was never able to get even average grades. A lot of which had to do with the nature of my dad’s job. We moved around a lot, including abroad where I lacked proper schooling.

11 and 12 grade are super important in our country because they decide the university you will get in. I was so badly prepared for 11 that I decided to repeat. And when I repeated I failed. I had zero hope of getting anywhere.

But still I applied to every university possible. I knew that would only get into shitty ones. But by an absolute stroke of luck I got into a very good university (top 5 or something). I had an excellent entrance test score somehow and I forgot my result card so they just assumed I passed 11th grade (which I later did but not at the time). Very lucky.

University life was super tough for me. I had to study twice as hard as other to get half the results others were getting. I was so very close to failing multiple courses every semester but somehow I always managed to pass by slimiest of margins. My GPA was only 2.58/4 (that too thanks to COVID) but I graduated in 4 years. Very lucky again.

I started applying for jobs before my last semester even began. I was starting to see how my low GPA was holding me back. Everyone who started applying after me got the jobs they wanted. I was left behind. Felt extremely bad but I kept looking. 

My cousin referred me to a Big 4 firm. They don’t hire from our university, they only hire CPA or ACCA and i was just a Bsc student. The hiring process is also very tough. Tests and interviews. I gave my best and somehow I cleared it all. Turns out they were very short staffed so they made an exception for me. Very lucky again.

Its been 3 months and the job is going fine. But I do feel dumb compared to others as their knowledge is way more then me. I still do my best, I always pretend that I know shit when in reality I don’t. I constantly live in this fear that one day I will be exposed and it will all come crumbling down. They will know I just got into university by luck, i got into the firm by luck. In reality I don’t have the credentials for this job. I failed 5th grade, I failed 11th twice, i hardly passed university.

On the other hand many people who know me believe that i got into university and the firm because my father is somewhat influential. That is absolutely not the case. He dint even know I applied to these place till I got in.

It hurts a lot living with this fear everyday.  I hate this and sometimes want to get out and quit. I have no idea how to over come this fear. I dont know what to do.",anticipation

3636,"This is my first time posting here.
I, 34M, am highly doubting my work competences.
I’ve been reading about imposter and think this is what I have.

Let me give background. I come from a family of High intellectual potentials. Although never tested, both my sisters are diagnosed.
I am very sensitive to the opinion of others.

In school, I always succeeded with little effort. I never hid that I did not work and got many jealousy as a result. So I hid my grades.
In university, I got great grades while my gf, now wife, had a harder time, although we studied the same. (She made the schedule).

I’m quite sure I wouldn’t have gotten my degree without her planning.

After my master, I did a PhD, got praise from the jury. But if you ask me, I’ll tell you my research wasn’t worth it, it contributed 0 to science and only got published because my supervisor was good at writing.

I did a Postdoc but then completely changed field.
I felt inadequate in that job, that I wasn’t properly qualified for it.
During my postdoc, I passed a teacher certification, which was easy. 
I couldn’t continue the classes, so I ended up going straight for the jury and received the certification, thanks to my good memories from the previous year lesson.

I did not start working as a teacher, I did something completely different still.
I’ve been doing that job for 3 years. I started mid 2019 and we soon had Covid. I have been unable to resume “as before”. I feel like nothing I do makes a difference so I avoid doing. I’m failing this job and my boss will soon figure it out. Although so far no one said I was doing an inappropriate job.

I then requested to change position in August. And am transitioning positions currently.

Todays, had a progress meeting and was only told I need to make sure I plan and prioritize better. I know this is a weakness I have. I’m too « hot », in the moment.

I procrastinate until last minute and then rush to finish. Mostly because tasks seem impossible. And am not happy because the result is not exactly as I imagined it.

Now I’m lost.
Is it imposter, am I just incompetent, am I really not organized enough, am I just too perfectionist?
I feel like I’m exaggerating thinking it’s imposter.

I’m thinking of seeking help, but first, how do you tell your wife you feel like a failure undeserving of your position?

I always get nervous about presentations and talks but this is a whole other level. I’ve been feeling sick and dizzy since I agreed to it (why oh why did I agree to it - oh yeah, because if I didn’t I’d feel like an even bigger imposter), I’ve had a tension headache for a few days now, last night I woke up the pain was so bad, and it’s like my whole body is just really tense all the time and I have this constant sense of dread that I cannot shake.

Maybe I have anxiety. If I don’t feel better after the presentation I’ll go to the GP.

I think what’s making it worse is it’s with my boss (or in front of him) and I already feel like he made a mistake hiring me and I’m not the person he thought I was. I wasn’t going to apply because I thought it was too much of a step up for me, but my recruiter talked me into it, and by some miracle I did well in the interview. Normally I’m bad at interviews but know I can do the job. This time it was like I became one of those people who interviews well but doesn’t really have what it takes to deliver.

It’s also probably the most objectively important presentation I’ve ever had to do.

I’ve never messed up a presentation before, in fact people have even complimented me on them in the past (I think they’re pleasantly surprised because I make no secret of how much I hate doing them - to colleagues, not the people I’m presenting to), but I can’t help thinking this is the one I’m going to mess up. It doesn’t help that my many practice runs still aren’t great and don’t seem to be getting better. It especially doesn’t help that I’m going to be presenting on Teams, which I’ve never done before, and our whole IT system is changing tomorrow. 

The sad thing is, even if I have another miracle and it goes well tomorrow, I know that won’t be enough for me to believe I’m not an imposter and I can and should do this job. I’ll just pass it off as a fluke or dismiss it as inconsequential. There’s always another way I could fail - another way I have to prove myself.

3647,"I’ll try to make this quick. I’m a 20 year old birth doula. If you don’t know what that means, it’s a female-only non-medical support career for women giving birth. I’m trained in physical comfort measures, methods such as hypnobirthing, mediation/emotional support, and advocacy for my clients’ decisions about their labor and birth.

This is a field that has just recently started to grow in popularity, and despite how simple it may sound, certification is a long, hard process. I’m extremely passionate about the importance of birth and how the idea of it has been corrupted to seem like a medical emergency in every scenario, and modern hospitals routinely abuse mothers in labor. My desire to change this has kept me going for 2 years. I’m completely trained, yet still uncertified due to the last steps being hands-on experience among other things. The pandemic has kept doulas out of hospitals, making it extremely difficult to find clients for my 3 certifying births, especially as a brand new doula. 

Recently, I’ve taken some steps that have finally led 3 clients to contact me. I’m aware that all three are mostly interested in my low fee, which is less than a third of what experienced and certified doulas charge. Regardless, I need these 3 births to get certified and begin growing my practice. 

Working with a doula client involves both gathering all information about their pregnancy, birth history, desires for their birth plan, and health information, as well as educating the client on certain decisions, comfort measures, procedures, and birth physiology. There are generally two prenatal meetings preceding the birth and one postpartum meeting afterwords. I’ve held two meetings for different clients. 

It’s overwhelming having little guidance while jumping into such a large career. No one tells you how to run a prenatal meeting. Your textbook knowledge has to be accurate and unbiased. You have to be intuitive to a laboring woman’s needs when she can’t express them verbally. You need to be an expert at active listening and mediation without any personal input or advice.   You need to have thick skin and be open to rejection and criticism from doctors, nurses, clients, other doulas, midwives, and close-minded people who believe there’s a “right” way to give birth. 

With the lack of support, training, and insight, I slaved over creating an itinerary with minuscule help from Google and a few of my birth books before I ran my first meeting. This is where it gets tough. I know the meeting went well, but I still went home and cried. No matter how much I prepare or how well I know I’ve done, I can’t make myself believe I actually belong here. After my second meeting, I was 100% convinced that the couple wanted nothing to do with me. That they’d opted out of wanting a doula after all and they would just ghost me. Of course, this was not the case but it seemed so real in my head. 

At one point, I made an Instagram post about the importance of skin to skin contact directly after birth to meet my “one social media post per month” quota for a local doula group I’m in. A midwife dm’d me, disagreeing with a claim I made about newborn discomfort in the birth canal. I’d read about this fact before and it was even brought up in my initial doula training. I was sure I was correct, yet I was sent into one of the worst spirals of self-hatred of my life. I’d never felt so incompetent. My thoughts had never been scarier. I was convinced that everyone I had status with had seen the post and disagreed with it and I was now the laughing stalk of the area. I then pinned this idea to the itinerary of an upcoming meeting with my doula group, and I was convinced one of the topics was added because of my post. I emailed the leader of the group (actually it turns out I emailed THE ENTIRE BOARD) with a panicked message about how sorry I was. She had no idea what I was talking about and I completely humiliated myself as a new, inexperienced member.

Just today, I received a text from a client saying she was checking into an appointment with her midwife that I had agreed to attend. I’d forgotten to put it on my calendar, and I was currently tied up with one of my 3 other jobs, which was nannying my infant nieces. I had to explain the situation and apologize profusely and I could tell she wasn’t impressed. I’ve been thrown between beating myself up and distracting myself all day.

Somehow, every time I move forward, I feel like absolute shit. Every time I make a mistake I feel like absolute shit. Every single thing I do makes me want to give it all up because I can never ever be good enough. People tell me I’m born for this field and it’s my calling. This is genuinely my dream career and I want to believe them. Everyone says that every doula is important because we all offer different skills and personality traits. I want to know I’m not just the one exception to that. I’m working my ass off and pouring so much time and money into getting my life started, but I just don’t feel like I’m good enough. I hate this feeling so much. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and confidently learn from my mistakes, but both just make me hate myself. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in therapy and I’ve done all the natural mental health support I can do and nothings changing. I’m terrified for when I actually support my first birth (I’ve attended two as a shadow to an experienced doula but never been the primary.) I’m worried the self-doubt is the only thing holding me back and it’s eventually going to tear me down. 

Does anyone have advice other than what shows up on the first page of Google when you look up “how to stop imposter syndrome”? I’m so sick of being afraid and doubting myself.",trust

Like soon he will realize (if he hasn’t already) that I am not as intelligent, attractive, or compatible enough of a person to be in a relationship with. Last few months I have been attributing these feelings to me personally feeling like we are incompatible in certain ways. (For example, he is vegan and passionate about it while I am not. And he is very politically active while I am not) but today I realized that the heart of the matter is that I just feel like a shallower, worse person overall which makes me feel like he deserves a better partner. I just get really anxious when those topics come up and that I have to say the right thing or else he will realize how stupid I am or smth like that. I am extra sensitive because of it. It’s a heartbreaking feeling that makes me self sabotage and say negative things about the relationship that I regret later on.

3650,"I'm a wedding photographer in the UK and have done it since around 2014. I started by doing a few friends weddings and it grew from there to where I now have almost 50 weddings a year.  

I used to really enjoy the job and my work but the more I do it, the faker I feel and the more I worry. I feel that I've marketed myself really well rather than people booking me for my work itself. I feel that I have a fairly realistic idea of how good I am at wedding photography and while I wouldn't put myself at the very bottom, I know I have a long way to go before I would ever like my own work.   

A couple who live in Canada found my Instagram and have booked me for their wedding in France which is happening in a weeks time. I have never felt more like a fraud in my entire life. The pressure is huge. They are paying me to go to France to take their wedding photos. This is now no longer that I just happen to be a local wedding photographer who knows a local venue well.... this is now a case where someone has found me and could have picked anyone in the entire UK or most of Europe! Why me? My work really isn't that good! It's average at best. I rarely even post on Instagram so I don't even know how they came across my page.   

The pressure of photographing their wedding and delivering their images is now weighing so heavy on my shoulders. I'm already going through a mental battle right now with medical testing for what could be a serious life-threatening disease. The added pressure of now having to go to France next week to photograph a wedding is huge.    

I don't even get much feedback from couples anymore either. I used to send off the photos and they would email me back telling me how much they love their photos and then would write a review. I've not had that much recently. I send the photos off and hear absolutely nothing from them ever again. So naturally I ruminate and think that they dislike their images. I keep wondering if I'm doing something different than I used to or if I've become complacent but I'm not so sure. I put in so much effort on my wedding days.  

I don't know. I just have no confidence at all at the moment and the lack of that and feedback makes me want to quit.... but what other job could I do to earn this sort of money and only work 1 day a week?? Sorry for my rambling.",trust

Today, I went with a colleague to a local country club his family has been a part of for generations. He’s sponsoring me to become a member.

3656,"So my understanding of imposter syndrome is pretty limited but I’m pretty sure I’ve developed it.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I’ve done good. I’ve made mistakes, gotten subpar marks like everyone else but I was almost always able to pull it together when it mattered - GCSEs, A Levels, uni exams and assignments. This last year, the last year of my Bachelor’s, I seemed to be on track for a First, with me pulling myself through assignments with First-class marks.

And then I didn’t do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master’s program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It’s always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

Now I’m looking back on everything I’ve done well and it feels like a fluke, a fraud, that I was just lucky and wasn’t really worthy of the good marks and grades given to me. I’ve always been able to pull it together when it mattered but this is when it mattered the most and I didn’t do good enough.

People are saying that a 2:1 Bachelor’s is still good enough but I can’t say how much shame I’ve felt around it. Given my way I WOULDN’T be graduating right now - do you know how shit it feels to have graduation feel like a mark of shame rather than merit?!",trust

3658,"Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this forum. I basically wanted to vent some stuff I've had on my mind the past weekend. So, I graduated recently with my bachelor's in statistics in early May, and I have been job hunting since then until literally a few days ago. I managed to finally get what I would have considered my ""dream job"", a data analyst position at a big company with great benefits and a fantastic starting salary. I truly couldn't believe it when I got the call back that I had finally gotten the job offer after having interviewed countless times and even being rejected once from another company I really wanted to work with.

Now, I struggle with incredibly low self-esteem in general. Although I graduated with the top of my class and had a near 4.0 grade point average, I still considered myself less than adequate for one reason: I had very little relevant work experience. I knew some programming languages sure as was required by my school coursework, but because I was a commuter student I wasn't involved in any fancy professional clubs/orgs, I had no internships in the field to speak of, and when I originally graduated, I was terrified I'd end up in a terrible job I didn't want doing something I was going to be bad at because all I really know how to do was study hard, learn really hard math, and get good grades.

I was and still am shocked as hell I managed to actually get my foot in the door as an official business analyst doing what I had originally went to college to do. But I feel like that initial anxiety I had still hasn't gone away. Now, I'm worried about basically ""fucking it up"". I didn't lie to them about knowing technologies I didn't know, it was obvious from my resume and the stories I chose to tell to them during my interviews that I had no internship experience and was basically a brand new freshie.

I basically just tried to convince them that I knew how to analyze datasets and math and could communicate difficult concepts to people. Which, honestly, I believe I can do. But at the same time, I'm not an expert by any means in any of the softwares I have used. In college, when given the choice to do something with software or by hand, I almost always did it by hand because I just preferred that, and I learned better doing that.

So I guess basically I'm wondering if what I'm going through is the dreaded imposter syndrome I've always heard about in fields such as these. I always felt deep down that I wasn't good enough, and I was shocked anyone decided to give me a chance at all. Part of me wants to tell myself that if they thought I wasn't going to be able to do the job, they wouldn't have hired me. I was a first-generation college student, no one has ever done a job like I'm doing in my family, and I literally have no frame of reference. I feel like I'm in undiscovered territory, and I have no idea what my first day is going to be like and what my manager is going to expect from me for the first few weeks. I just don't want to let anybody down, and I want to be what I have to be. What should I do?",trust

So I started a new job about 7 weeks ago, it is a complete change of scenery and a male dominated industry but I do enjoy it.

My therapist a few months ago said I may suffer from imposter syndrome (I haven’t be diagnosed with it, not sure if it’s even a diagnosable thing). I believe this to be very true and I can back it up with evidence throughout the most recent years of my life in specific. The problem I’m having is that I have proven myself to have the talents and accomplishments of a top trader (top 1% and most likely even higher) but I can’t come to acceptance with them… 

When I was younger I resold sneakers and took a starting investment of $1k up to $100k over the next 3 years. I bought one of my favorite cars and it made me so happy. I mention this as it relates to what I’m feeling now. I have all the proof of my accomplishment and skills in reselling sneakers (my car, my track record of sales, etc). Two years ago I got into trading as a long term and stable career. Right out the gate I achieved great success (just like with selling shoes) but never capitalized on it due to me making mistakes. I have the talent and reuslts based on my performance to scale up to a great $ amount just like I have with shoes but I can’t believe it to be true (Imposter feelings). 

Trading is already very hard as it is but I have proven myself to have a great long term career in this. Things are starting to work out for me now that I haven’t been making mistakes but it’s like I can’t believe the success I have in store for me despite my greats results and proof of this (just like I did when I selling sneakers when I was 15).

I feel like it actually is harder for me to learn a complex subject than my peers, like for example if I’m solving a math problem I am aware that I “should” be able to do this much more efficiently although I always feel as if I am going through extra steps or strain in order to finally solve the problem. I know grades aren’t a indicator of anything but my friends try to tell me I’m smart because I get good grades, but that is only because I spend so much time studying, and anyone would be able to get the grade if they studied that much. My question is, what if I’m actually just stupid compared to others and I’m just good at giving off the impression of being “smart” but they don’t truly know how inefficient my brain works? Sure I like to have deep and philosophical thoughts but “deep” doesn’t mean “smart” and a stupid person can def be “deep”.",trust
3684,"I started reading ""Own Your Greatness"" by Dr. Lisa Oribe-Austin this week as I realized my anxiety and hopelessness were at an all time high at my new job. They're very excited to have me! Which has triggered some MASSIVE imposter syndrome.

Today, during a meeting, my boss asked me if I wanted my boss to run through my department's numbers or if I was OK doing it. I offered to do it just so I could get more familiar. It's my NINTH day, so of course I don't have it all down pat, and it showed. But guess what? They were still pleased. And then they moved on.

My little voice cropped up saying, ""You idiot - see? Now they all know you're a phony."" But I stopped myself and quickly rewrote the narrative - I was asked to do something on the spot I hadn't been prepped for, given the option to not do it, chose to do it for a logical reason, and didn't do it as smoothly as I will once I get my legs under me - yet I STILL met expectations. Because I'm good at what I do.

I didn't ""fumble"" because ""I'm an inherent failure."" I experienced a very normal situation and nobody batted an eye.

I can't even express how happy I am that I didn't sink into that hole. It is doable! Will I always succeed? No. I'll sink into it here and there. But at least I know what WORKS.",trust

And all I could think was “eh-I just read a recipe

3687,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don’t know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I’m so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my “thing”, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can’t you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your “thing”?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I’m not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I’m saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can’t I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I’m a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking. I feel like I am just not the type to succeed. And so I’ve decided that I want to start investigating instead of feeling this pressure in my chest and trying to logically calm myself.

My dad has offered me to get paid for cooking a while back. I declined, although my sister, who doesn't live at home, was very supportive of the idea. I told them I just liked cooking.

When I was asked what I wanted for my birthday, I didn't know what to say. It's not like there is nothing I want. There are a lot of things, but all of them seemed too expensive or hard to get. I honestly had no idea. I told my parents to not spend too much.

3690,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I need opinions - is my Dad right or is there something funny happening with the internship offer?",anticipation

I'm so scared I'm going to mess up production or that I'm not going to have enough ideas for my boss's liking. Essentially they want me to come in and improve little things like worker safety measures and production output. I have my Master's in industrial engineering but I have no clue how to put any of my textbooks to use. Feeling so confused on what to do, and I shouldn't be at all. 

I have to do research on a type of manufacturing process for this as well, because my boss is trusting me to understand how it works. I've just been at home playing Minecraft instead. It's like I *want* to show up unprepared, and the more I think about doing the research, the less I'm able to get done and the more angry I am with myself.

My manager looks at me like I'm a moron and says ""all you have to do is pick a date and determine exactly how we're going to do this"". Is that supposed to be simple? It doesn't sound simple.

Every time I make those sorts of calls, I get ripped a new asshole. Honestly I feel like some fucked up weirdo because I don't think the same, or communicate the same way as the rest of them. 

Often times what I say is misunderstood even though I think I'm being perfectly clear. I'm ridiculously insecure about how I speak and write because people don't seem to understand me. It's gotten to the point where I sometimes have other people (outside of work) read over what I'm going to say because I'm not confident that I can express myself in a way that my coworkers will understand. It's not an actual language barrier. We're all native English speakers, but sometimes it really doesn't feel that way.

While I was at the office before this pandemic, I had these thoughts that maybe I am not good enough for the job requirements but they were not so active because my co-workers are great and my boss keeps having great conversations with us which makes me feel comfortable at work. Now, by working remotely, conversations with other co-workers are not so frequent and that makes me think everybody is working harder than I am. 

I also had this feeling that my supervisors are constantly looking at the chat to spot if I am online or not and whenever I did a break, I felt guilty and I tried to be back at work as soon as possible because my brain kept telling me ""Your boss probably has already called several times and you are here....having lunch.....pffff, you really do not deserve this job"".

3730,"I am a person with pretty serious anxiety, depression, ADHD and imposter syndrome of some sort. Usually my symptoms/behavior are pretty manageable. But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.
* The usual imposter stuff--""everyone at work finds me annoying/doesn't want to work with me, I don't belong there,"" etc. etc. etc.

Does anyone have resources, techniques or methods to help deal with these delusions? I would like to tell my therapist about them, but he has not been super helpful so far, due to his busy schedule and tendency to medicate instead of digging deeper into what is wrong with me.",joy
3732,"I began working at a software company only a month or so after I graduated with my bachelor's, about 3 years ago.

The company, the owner, the department heads, and nearly everybody else is happy, super polite and nice, upbeat every day, Type-A, and really fucking smart. I didn't think I had any business, much less skill and social skills at all, to be working with so many people like that.

I was anxious, depressed, nearly throwing up every morning before work for months and months, and thinking I might be fired at any moment once they discovered that I was a fraud and not as smart as they thought I was at my interview.

I felt like such a fish out of water for the first year, at least, before I started to even get a little bit comfortable. Even then I only felt like I was barely holding my head above water with the knowledge that I gained of the software I had to support on a daily basis.

Every quarter, we have a full company meeting, this last one being held virtually today due to the shit going on right now. Before each quarterly meeting, everybody in my department submits a nominee from within our group to be employee of the quarter.

This morning, at our virtual meeting, it was announced that I had been chosen as Employee of the Quarter from my service department. I can't express in words just how much it means to me that the peers I work with, by majority, found that I had done, helped, and taught well enough over the last few months, while we all worked from home, to deserve that award.

It might sound like an overreaction but it’s truly eating away my motivation and ability to focus. Behind every action I make, I have a voice tell me to “quit fooling yourself”, or “that’s not what the real you would do” and it slows me down.

A little context to my story, I’m recently pulling out of a deep depression from earlier this year that I’m proud of getting out of. But recently, somewhere in my mind the idea that I’m “supposed” to be depressed is beginning to arise. The idea of loneliness as well. It only magnifies my failures and shortcomings for me. 

It’s hard to control it, to fight it, but it’s like it’s relentless. I’ve tried becoming hyper aware of my thought processes and being mindful but that’s only made me more aware of my shortcomings.

These thoughts rule my mind, the ideas of doing something with my life get blanketed by reminders that I’ve fucked up. That I’ve failed a million times and am terrible at being confident. 

I honestly don’t know who I am because of how many times I’ve reinvented my personality from the ground up to fight depression and escape.

3746,"A quick note - I only discovered information about imposter syndrome within the past 24 hours and I feel like I have really discovered what has been happening to me most of my life. 

&nbsp;


Last year I was offered a Leadership/Management Internship position at Walt Disney World - something that I have worked towards since my high school grad in 2011! I was placed into housekeeping leadership though I had no prior experience in it (all my leadership experience was front desk or merchandise) so I felt like I was thrown into unfamiliar territory. 


&nbsp;


I was there for about 6 months (internship was for 1 year and a potential permanent position was available at the end of it), assisted in opening a new resort, and about 3 months in I began to have extreme anxiety attacks at work - I would lock myself in my office and cry and have trouble catching my breath. The role as a leader wasn’t difficult per se, the role itself was something that I could do on a day to day basis. I told my parents and my s/o that I was out-of-place, that I missed guest interaction (there was little to no daily guest interaction unless there was a guest to apologize to), and that I felt like I didn’t fit in.


&nbsp;


Whereas those were all the truth, I feel like I didn’t tell them the full truth. I am extremely terrified of failing and letting people down. I felt like in a position of leadership at this level, I had so much daily weight put on me and I was scared I would fail (even though I had only received praise from my peers and those above me). Eventually I was struggling to get out of bed for what was meant to be my “dream job”, or at least the start of it. I began to question what I wanted to for so long. I left that position and took a general merchandiser position (non-leadership) within the parks and now I feel so unfulfilled but worried to try to step into a leadership position. I’m not even sure what I’m looking for...advice or validation? I’m terrified of applying for another leadership position in fear that this will happen again..I have no idea.

With the extra time I passed the exam & did fairly well. But the whole time I was getting more & more depressed, I was guessing answers & knew I was failing & didn’t know what would happen.

And a friend, who is nice to ppl, & a father, failed the exam. He deserves to be here, I don’t. This is just adding to my guilt & imposter-y feeling. If he had more time he would’ve passed, it’s just unfair.

3750,"I am new to this sub but I wanted to throw a suggestion out. One of the pieces of advice I received about managing imposter syndrome was to keep a running list of positive feedback, accomplishments (big or small), successes, and compliments to reflect on and help to combat feelings of incompetence and not belonging.  

I wonder if folks on here would find any value in having a weekly thread where everyone could just comment with their weekly successes, accomplishments, or positive feedback received. I was thinking there would be no expectation about what success (etc.) means. Someone could write that they remembered to water the plants this week or they got a B on a paper or someone complimented the way they drafted that email or they felt like they might look dumb but they mustered the courage to ask that question in class anyway. The central idea being that it might help us remind ourselves that we do have skill, we are competent, we do belong. It could be a way for us to support one another as well. 

One potential downside I could see is that if folks are listing their successes it might make someone feel more like an imposter if they don't feel like they have something to contribute. Or with the process of upvoting someone might feel bad because they only got 2 but someone else got 10. But my hope would be that we could all support each other in whatever successes people post whether it seem small or large. If folks are interested we could assess how it's going after a few weeks or so and make sure it's helpful, not harmful.

3752,"I’ve had IS for quite some time and it’s ruined my ability to form relationships with people who just want to support me. I can’t take a compliment or accept their praise and they get frustrated, even verbally angry at me for not “understanding my worth”. This has lead to tension between my mother and I because she always wanted to uplift me and I felt guilty, as she was wasting time and energy on me. I then feel guilty that I’m rejecting love and support when there are a lot of people who are not fortunate enough to have a mother so loving. It’s sends me in a spiral, further enforcing my belief that I don’t deserve anything good, I was just lucky enough to be given a mom like her.

She passed away 7 months ago. I never got to tell her how grateful I am to have her constant support while I was struggling, (with mental illness and sobriety). I miss her more than words can describe.

One thing I hate is people telling me that I’m doing surprisingly well dealing with her death, which I take as a back handed compliment. Shouldn’t I be grieving more dramatically because she was so important to me? Why am I happy sometimes even though she’s gone? Are people expecting me to relapse because of the tragedy? How can people say that they admire my bravery and strength to carry on, especially when I spend hours stuck in the past, trying to remember her?

I feel like I’m only “doing surprisingly well” because I have shoved everything down and I am not working hard enough in therapy to address my grief, I’m only repeating what I’ve read in books or posts of what the stages of dealing with grief look and sound like. I lie about my feelings to everyone, even my therapist. My therapist praises me for not relapsing into self destructing habits, but I feel like I haven’t fallen back on those because I don’t want to disappoint my mom, even though she is no longer here. The idea that I’m “strong” is scary to me. I feel like these compliments create so much doubt in my head, causing me to relapse because that is what is expected of me. 

Through all of this, I don’t have my mom’s unconditional support to fall back on when I feel my life is a sham, I don’t have that one person who loves me no matter who I think or pretend I am. It’s tricky navigating my thoughts and feelings alone and I feel like I’ve been killing myself looking for reassurance from other sources, like my work or social media, so much so that I have neglected working on my relationships with my family, who is hurting too. I don’t want to let them down the same way I let my mom down so many times, nor do I want to have them worry about me, or spend time and energy trying to support me as I will never truly feel validated.

Work as the old one however this time it’s federal. Due to the nature of my job and it’s strict physical and mental standards I shall leave what i do undisclosed.  However I have been doing what I love for about 9 years and since I took this jump of occupation day one I never thought I was good enough.  I had my struggles as anyone else would for this career field however I made it when so many have doubted me. And I continue to thrive with what I do with each new job only gave me an additional stepping stone to where I am today.  I am totally with the big shots a dream of mine I never thought would come true.  

But here I am full of doubt prob more doubt then when I first took this leap to do this kine of job.  Every bump in the road I faced and over come.  Here I am week 4 into training and even tho it appears I’m doing fine inside I am not.  Ever drive home from work I jus look back and can’t help to think that I am not ready for this.  Regardless of my past experience.  

I study and study and yet fear jus seems to get the best of me.   I try to think of the path that got me here cuz it truly shows I belong here and I should know my worth.  But still FEAR and disappointment just takes over every time.  

How can I over come this cuz the anxiety is starting to take its toll and I seriously don’t know what to do.  This job took me away from my friends and family all the support one would need to get through this.  But this was the dream I wanted yet here I am full of doubt.

3775,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr. I learned recently that she consistently tops their exams, amidst her peers who, like me, finished from top universities. I can't help but feel that this only reinforces my own imposter syndrome. If my friend who went to the same unknown university as I did, performed as well as me, even getting the exact same honor and exact same score in the medical admission test I did, yet she's performing spectacularly in med school whereas I'm now below average, then it only means I really did just luck out on my achievements so far. Heck maybe my professors in college were generous and awarded me top-notch grades. Maybe she had stricter professors who would've given her a better mark if she's been their student.",trust

However I'm extremely terrified at the same time, I have this dark feeling like I'm going to fail. Last Friday, I attended an orientation/training for work and I was panicking all day because I was constantly being reminded of how unprepared I felt to actually start this job. During an afternoon meeting, I had a really weird experience that I had never seen happen before, like a stronger version of imposter syndrome.

I was in a meeting and I had what I can only describe as a feeling of a ""moment of clarity,"" except in the moment, I was genuinely feeling like ""how did I get here?"" ""How did I get hired?"" ""How could this possibly be my life?"" I felt like I was sitting in a chair inside my own mind, not in control of my situation, and as if I had navigated myself to a place where I shouldn't be. I felt SO stupid because along with this, I felt the uncontrollable urge to start crying and I think my supervisor noticed (one of my new coworkers conveniently went to check up on me after I saw her leaving his office).

Even my dissertation. I just feel like I took information from organic chemistry books and websites and that I don't actually deserve any credit because if I hadn't had resources I wouldn't have been able to have done it. It's like I believe that if I didn't just *know* something without having to research it first that I don't really know it at all, even if I made sure I understood everything before I wrote about it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it. I just feel like I'm not actually an intelligent individual and I'm just really good at pretending to be. I look at other people who're graduating from the same course as me and think they must know more than me or they must actually deserve it compared to what I've been doing.

Now I'm not at uni anymore and I'm applying for jobs, I'm terrified that I'm not capable of working in the industry I've been studying for the last 3 years. The longer I spend applying for jobs and not hearing anything back, the worse I feel, because there's obviously a reason why nobody's responding to my applications.

I just feel like I've been given a good degree for lying about being smart and that now I'm not going to be able to use it and I just spent £27k on something I'm going to have on my wall whilst I work in a supermarket because I can't get a job anywhere else.

1. i did get accepted into a *really* good college, which i committed to, but i feel like i shouldn't have because a) its easy to get in, hard to stay in, so ill probably drop out anyway. b) everyone is gonna be so much smarter and better than me. c) it costs so much to pay international tuition and even though my dad said its okay, i feel really bad for choosing the more expensive option d) my grade aren't even that great
2. i feel like i shouldn't have friends because i'm always thinking about what i don't like about a person to make me distance myself from them, i'm always the afterthought friend, i always feel like i have to put up a front for each and every person for them to like me and i'm just lying to everybody. I also constantly feel like every nice act that someone does to me is fake. it's like in my head if: someone compliments me = they're being fake nice out of manners, someone does something nice for me = they're pitying me. this is even down to things like homework.
3. ever since i was a kid, my parents constantly compared me as inferior to my older sisters, so every single decision in my life that i made has been to distinguish myself from them. my grades are better, i got into a better university, i'm more ""obedient"" to my parents, etc yet i still get ""why aren't you as smart/responsible/organised/blahblahblah as your sister?"". To family and friends, my sisters are the ""successful one"", the ""smart one"" and i'm always, ""the one that's good at looking pretty"". I want to be recognised as intelligent and ambitious too. The other day my sister got her hair cut in the same haircut that i've been planning for two years (she didn't know, so it isn't her fault) and i got so upset about being compared to her if i did cut my hair like that (we look really similar), that i impulse cut my hair a really different hairstyle.
4. i feel like everything i do isn't enough. when i got accepted to college, the first things my mother asked me were ""on what grounds?"" ""can they take it back"" and then ""where is (name of my friend she really likes) going? medicine? omg i'm so proud of her!"" and every time my college topic comes up, she only talks about my friend and how amazing she is. my mother hasn't talked to me about college once. today, while we were taking about a trip that i'll take alone to my hometown, i told her my sister and her boyfriend would pick me up from the airport, and she said to me, ""nobody cares enough to go that far for you.""

3789,"To give details but not too specifically, I attend an elite university on the East Coast. I gained a full-scholarship there and gained a full-scholarship in high school too. Although, I have grown to be OK with rich people, in high school, I deeply resented almost all of my classmates as I felt that it was unjust the circumstances I grew up in (living with family in one bed room apt, subletting,  being food insecure, and even cleaning offices/houses with my mom on weekends). It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter. I had nightmares very very often and would wake up at like 4 or 5 AM to edit group presentations just so i wouldn't let other people down. 

In college, it's a lot better since people can't come over and what not and are somewhat more mature. But, now that I am an upperclassman, I feel an immense pressure to go into IB/Finance. I received some Bulge Bracket firm interviews and even made it to final round, but didn't get the summer internship. I felt like I was a failure to my family and to myself and to the expectations of my colleagues in college. I don't know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel that IB/finance is meant for the rich and that they ovviously have an upper hand while I have to fight to get myself a position. Even stupid jocks get jobs just b/c of alumni connections. It's just discouraging ......

3793,"Hi everyone!

I've  been on a journey to improve my mental well-being and develop healthier thought patterns. Over the past year, I've faced challenges with  anxiety and found it difficult to break out of negative thought cycles. A. I  tried mindfulness exercises, but however hard I tried, I couldn't shut  off my thoughts. That's why I started looking for a different approach. That's when I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I started  challenging my unrealistic thoughts and learned how to react to them in a  more reasonable way.

However, doing this on your own, instead of with a therapist, is difficult. Even if you have a therapist, you only get help once a week instead of every time you are struggling with negative thoughts. So, I took matters  into my own hands and developed an app to make the process more  accessible and user-friendly. Here's how the app works:

1. Write a note whenever you find yourself overwhelmed by unhelpful thoughts.
2. The app analyzes your note, identifying common cognitive distortions.
3. Receive personalized suggestions to challenge and reframe your thoughts.

I've already got a couple hundred users and great feedback but I feel like imposter syndrome is basically the definition of distorted thinking, so I thought this might help a lot of you fighting imposter syndrome, and help me tailor the apps to your needs. The app is available as a beta on iOS and Android. 

If you're interested in trying it out and sharing your thoughts, please leave a comment or send me a direct message or join the Discord community where you can find all links you need: [https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3](https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3)

Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong.

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""...

My water broke. I didn’t fully believe it, thought I was just extra leaky. I start feeling contractions and think that I’m being DRAMATIC over some cramps. Finally get to the hospital, contractions kick up to the peak of pain and I’m thinking that again, I’m being dramatic. That there’s no way this is true labor and I’m gonna walk out still pregnant and a $15000 hospital bill for wasting their time. 

It wasn’t until my husband asked them to check me that we found out I was 10cm and ready to push. Idk maybe it was a good thing to have imposter syndrome? I guilted myself to suffer through a full labor without pain meds 😂",anticipation

I am a 62-year-old male and today is the first time I have heard someone describe what I have been feeling all my life. here are some thoughts I have even when I was a child.

1. Shame and Guilt, they say that we cannot to born with shame or guilt but I have always felt like I am guilty, of what? I do not know but I have the feeling of being found out.
2. That I am a fraud, a fake I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop. waiting for the cops to arrive and arrest me for what I don't know, for a crime I have not committed but feel guilty just the same.
3. I Cannot accept positive affirmations or take credit for good deeds I shut the words down as fast as I can and change the subject. My wife of 30 years believes that I am a thoughtful, loving, and generous person and yet I cannot let myself believe any of it.

**Identify and challenge your limiting beliefs.** While they have many guises, most limiting beliefs can be distilled down to two essential beliefs: I’m not good enough & I’m not worthy. We may also carry over beliefs from our early years which served us well then but now hinder us as adults.

**Recognize – and celebrate - your small victories.** Whatever small victories are meaningful to you. Within the context of having strategic plans, each small step is a victory in itself and also a step towards something so much bigger.

**Take responsibility for your current situation.** When you take responsibility, you take control. And when are in control, you have options and choices.

**Do something for others.** Creating meaning for yourself and value for others helps build your win / win relationship with the world around you.

**Take a step each day toward your ideal self.** We all have the same 168 hours each week – that’s just physics – the issue is what we choose to do with them. Adopting the habit of frequently asking yourself: what would be the most valuable thing I can do right now that would be a step in the right direction?

**Manage your self-talk.** We all talk to ourselves – it’s just how our brains work. When we choose to take control of our internal dialogue, we can make it work for us.

**Focus on the value adding activities.** When we think about what we have on our plate, considering how important and how urgent each item is really puts things in perspective. When we focus our efforts on what is important – in the context of what we have chosen to achieve – we’re moving in the right direction.

**Avoid comparing yourself to others.** This points to the difference between self-esteem (externally focused) and self-worth (internally focused). The only valid comparison is our previous self.

**A healthy self-image is central to our wellbeing. By adopting these habits, we can help ourselves to keep moving in the right direction.**",trust

3823,"TL;DR: I landed an internship at the highest ranked law firm in my country bc I’m skilled at taking exams, not because I’m super smart. Also, my writing skills aren’t great.

Any advice? - Not necessarily looking for life changing solutions (although welcome!), but any advice/tips/words of encouragement or other opinions are appreciated :) 

*edit: the ‘highest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it’s one of the reasons why I don’t belong there

—-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I’ve been more insecure than ever lately & I’m having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‘ranked’ #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don’t always say everything - but let’s just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it’s because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‘honors/cum laude’ grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I’m not trying to say I’m absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I’m not actually super talented, I’m just good at ‘taking exams’ + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I’m neurodivergent and am quite ‘slow’ in understanding things (even if it’s something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren’t so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‘grade’ I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I’m a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

3824,"Hi Reddit.   
I want to caveat this post by saying I know how lucky I am and that I have realised suffering is relative and money does not mean happiness. Not by a long shot. 

On paper life is great. Earlier this year I came up with an idea with some friends and we build this company which we promptly sold (finalising last week). At the same time, ive met a woman of my dreams. Loving, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.   


Last week, I got paid for selling the company. I now have more money than I know what to do with and the love of a beautiful woman. Everything should be great right?   


When I got paid out last Friday I started having panic attacks and questioning my happiness. Not so much if I deserve it but coming to terms that, somehow, for reasons I cant really put my finger on I am not happy. I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in my life at a fairly early age but it has caused me to realise that I didnt even know what I truly wanted.   


I started withdrawing into myself in regards to my relationship almost immediately. Questioning my feelings and thoughts for this person who is changing my life for the better on a daily basis.   


I asked her for some space to try and figure this out and it backfired. Badly. To the point where she is saying I need to figure things out before I can ""have others in my life"".   


I now dont know what to make of it all. I am coming to terms with my new life but after working so hard for so long and going nowhere and being alone for so long only to have achieved all this ""success"" in both my personal and professional life so quickly has left me confused, anxious and extremely emotional.

But.........I feel like a rookie.

I also need to watch what I'm saying to people as my usual line at the minute is, well I'm new and still learning so I don't know all the answers etc etc but I'll try my best

3829,"I’m kinda realizing a glaring issue I have that tremendously hinders my time management and my school/life balance in general  

I’m a graphic design major. The first step in every project (or, like, project extension) is research. We research subject matter, connecting themes and concepts, color pallets, design styles, font choices and parings, design techniques etc. It’s an important part of our process, and then comes sketches and executing our chosen concept. (This all will be relevant in a min)

I’m in a super competitive design program. Two portfolio review processes not before, but after semesters of design classes. Only 40 of the 400 end up making it. 
It was hell, but it’s my senior year and I’m almost finished. I used to really like graphic design, I was passionate about it. I worked my ass off to make it through the portfolio reviews.  I think I placed my whole identity and self worth in my ‘dream career’. I had so many anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns during the portfolio review portion of this degree (the first 2 years). Now I don’t have to worry about passing the review, but I think i was mentally in fight or flight mode for so long that my brain is still recovering and something isn’t quite right. 

Despite making it through both reviews, My confidence is shattered. I second guess every decision I make. Everyone around me is so talented and I feel like a fraud. I’ve worked really hard to get here, but I’m so burnt out I can barley function. I have pretty strong negative associations with school, class, my work, and myself. 


Every single night, we have assignments and things we need to present in the next class. And every single night, the same cycle repeats.

I research, research, research. I spend hours stuck gathering inspiration, jotting down concepts, all because I’m afraid of moving onto the next step. I don’t eat meals, I don’t spend time with friends, and I’m not even doing any of the ‘real’ work until my internal clock kicks in maybe around 3 AM or in the morning before class. It’s always rushed together and I’m never proud of it. Because I’m never proud of my work, doing homework the next day becomes even harder. My brain does NOT want to move past the research step. Ever. I never feel ready. I loop myself into a constant cycle of spending WAY to much time on a meaningless first step, neglecting the important work, and feeling shitty about myself. I’ll be on my laptop after hours of throwing together pages and pages of mood boards I will hardly use, still doing the same thing and mentally screaming at myself to stop and I can’t. I never do, until the very last minute where I’ll have no other choice to.
I am self aware that this isn’t helping me, and yet every time in the moment I’ll still subconsciously justify it by convincing myself ‘at least I’m being productive rn, I’ll move on to the next step soon."" (It’s never soon) Im so upset at myself because I know if I could actually manage my time I’d have have the time to get everything done that I need to and still enjoy things like spending time with people, making meals, getting enough sleep, etc. I have the time to make quality work, too. It’s like I don’t let myself do any of that. 

I’ve pulled 5 all-nighters in the first 4 weeks. I’ve already missed 3 classes and been 30 min late to 2. Again, I don’t hang out with friends, I hardly ever eat full meals, i don’t go to parties or bars or play video games or any of that. It feels like this is all I do and my work is never good and I’m just making myself miserable. I’m so upset at myself and I deeply regret the hours and hours I waste on a daily basis.

My entire college experience has been like this, except at some point I was actually motivated by a love for graphic design. At this point I just want it to be over. I’m so tired, I feel defeated. There’s no way this is even a viable career option for me if I can’t even balance my projects in college.

After a point I’d just do it for laughs, but last time I did(not a FAANG but pretty up there! about 4 months ago), I landed an interview. My reaction? I was laughing, OUT LOUD and kinda ready to fall flat on my face during this process (Thought it would be one hell of an experience). It was supposed to be a very thorough process with 5, FIVE different rounds! as I was told. Well I did the first one ready to be rejected right away(even though I was prepping hard). To my surprise, I received an email with the schedule for the next one a couple days later while I was still working. if you’re curious about what my response was - I took sometime to read the email over and over again just to make sure this was not just a hallucination, walked straight from my home office to my bedroom and did my happy dance LOL

In summary, I wasn’t hoping to get in at all since I didn’t apply with the intention/drive to making it. Given that they absolutely destroyed me in the last one, I was now ready for a very generic rejection email. But hear me out - I GOT IN PEOPLE!

I always get nervous about presentations and talks but this is a whole other level. I’ve been feeling sick and dizzy since I agreed to it (why oh why did I agree to it - oh yeah, because if I didn’t I’d feel like an even bigger imposter), I’ve had a tension headache for a few days now, last night I woke up the pain was so bad, and it’s like my whole body is just really tense all the time and I have this constant sense of dread that I cannot shake.

Maybe I have anxiety. If I don’t feel better after the presentation I’ll go to the GP.

I think what’s making it worse is it’s with my boss (or in front of him) and I already feel like he made a mistake hiring me and I’m not the person he thought I was. I wasn’t going to apply because I thought it was too much of a step up for me, but my recruiter talked me into it, and by some miracle I did well in the interview. Normally I’m bad at interviews but know I can do the job. This time it was like I became one of those people who interviews well but doesn’t really have what it takes to deliver.

It’s also probably the most objectively important presentation I’ve ever had to do.

I’ve never messed up a presentation before, in fact people have even complimented me on them in the past (I think they’re pleasantly surprised because I make no secret of how much I hate doing them - to colleagues, not the people I’m presenting to), but I can’t help thinking this is the one I’m going to mess up. It doesn’t help that my many practice runs still aren’t great and don’t seem to be getting better. It especially doesn’t help that I’m going to be presenting on Teams, which I’ve never done before, and our whole IT system is changing tomorrow. 

The sad thing is, even if I have another miracle and it goes well tomorrow, I know that won’t be enough for me to believe I’m not an imposter and I can and should do this job. I’ll just pass it off as a fluke or dismiss it as inconsequential. There’s always another way I could fail - another way I have to prove myself.

This year, most of my classes have in personal components, but the last two were all virtually online. Now my issue here is that, I hardly ever try for my classes and I pump out 90 after 90 and keep getting told that I’m doing so well and get told that they can see that I put effort into my writing. When in actuality, I put a total of 5 hours of effort, the day before it’s due. Getting this kind of feedback day in and out and then seeing people who ACTUALLY put in the effort getting 60’s and 50’s is crushing my mind with guilt and anxiety. I don’t even tel anyone my average because I don’t feel like I deserve it, even saying that I get 90’s while doing literally doing all the work last minute makes me sick to my stomach. 

For example, on a essay I had to write about a social topic of concern, I choose food scarcity. So did 5 other people. Now, I obviously left it to the last minute, threw some things together and BAM, essay done. Everyone else, took the entire 2 months allotted to this assignment that’s worth 40% of our overall grade to do it. Grades come back and I was fully expecting a 60% and I would’ve been okay with that. Turns out I got a 97% and everyone else, got a 68% or lower. And when everyone asked me how long did I work on it, I felt so guilty telling them that I worked on it for 8 hours before the deadline and got a 30% higher grade when they spent over a month researching and writing and editing. I’m by no means the smartest person in the room, and I definitely don’t feel like I deserve the grades that I’m somehow pulling out of thin air, but I can’t help but feel guilty over this. I even doubt if I have imposter syndrome? Or if i am just smart?  Idek

I feel stupid even though I'm predicted mostly As and A*s. Just typing that statement makes me feel stupid, as I think that my good grades should prove to me that im not stupid, so I shouldn't be suffering from imposter syndrome.
Also, I study by doing past papers, so I have to mark them myself. However, there are two problems with this. I usually have to stop marking half way through the paper because I'm too scared of what the end score will be that I feel like I can't keep marking to find out. I know that I might get a good score but I'm too scared of getting a bad score so I can't keep marking it.
Another problem is that if an answer is incorrect, sometimes I have to mark it correct just to keep a good score, even though getting that question wrong doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to get a bad score overall. This makes me feel bad because I'm lying, yet I can't seem to stop doing these things.

I'm a grad student and find myself doubting not just whether I belong in the program, but whether I know very basic things in my field, I mean stuff that you would learn in the first introductory course you take in undergrad. Logically I understand that I understand these concepts, but I can't shake the feeling that there's some Huge Fundamental Thing I am missing that everyone else gets and it's extra frustrating because I can't describe what this Huge Fundamental Thing is (probably because it doesn't exist) and therefore can't ask for help.

I’ve heard of imposter syndrome but never knew what it was. Turns out it’s exactly what a I’ve been suffering from for at least 10 years. It blew me away to read the symptoms and resonate with every single one of them. Things I could never put into words because it just feels like chaos in my brain.

3838,"I think I'm a fairly intelligent person, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists for over 30 years, but somehow until recently I hadn't heard the term ""imposter syndrome"". My entire life I would wait until someone became a really close friend and I would confess to them that I'm racked with these irrational fears of everyone finding out that I'm a fraud and completely unqualified to be who i am and because of these fears I tend to live my life in a cycle of creating perfection in my career, family, home, wardrobe, parenting, etc and then reaching some undefined peak, only to watch myself burn it all the ground. I've rebuilt my entire life so many times that I can't even count anymore. Now I've actually created my own company, surrounded myself in great people that all seem to think I'm some kind of genius, of which I am not, become financially successful (at least to some degree), kids are grown, marriage is stable, mental health is under control, and I've actually stuck with my current career for 10+ years. My work actually brings me joy. It also brings stress, bc it's work, but there is joy. But I'm also finding out that these feelings and fears I have are an actual thing with a name. At first that made me feel validated. I'm so glad that this sub exists and that the people here seem nice and supportive of each other. It's reassuring. It's also terrifying to know for sure that this isn't all in my head and I may be doomed to repeat this destructive cycle forever. I'm getting older. I can't keep destroying everything and rebuilding. I'm getting too old for it. Everyone understood when I was 20, a new parent, still finding myself. I know the fears are still there. I'm still terrified that I'm a complete fraud. I know that someday, any day now, people will realize that I never knew anything or even knew what I was doing as I trained others. Then those other people that I trained will have to explain themselves too. I know it's irrational, but I also know all too well how this story ends. I've been here many times before. Idk. I'm rambling now. 
I really just wanted to take a moment to say hello and thank all of you for being here and supporting one another. If nothing else, it's good to see that I'm not alone and now that I have a name for it maybe I can find some books and info that can help me avoid another apocalyptic breakdown.",trust

3842,"I battled a brain tumor called a vestibular schwannoma all of last year. It hurt. I was in so much pain, feeling so dizzy like a mix of a bad hangover and the stomach virus. I'd feel intensely weak, confused, and haunted by a vicious ringing in my ear. It was like hearing a bagpipe or teakettle going off in my ears 24/7, while the other symptoms happened EVERYDAY for hours on end, to barying degrees. The vertigo was also terrible. Sometimes I'd fall over. Sometimes I'd have a panic attack while going through it. Sometimes it'd last for hours. It would even keep me from sleeping. Then there are the dangerous situations I was put in because of the loss of balance and loss of hearing 

Due to the COVID pandemic, it was t easy to seek professional medical care. Doctors would make me wait months or even into the next year which I outright refused. I took my own data on my symptoms, my medication, my food, ans the time of day these symptoms happened, all to give insight and remove any extraneous variables as to what was happening. The ER doctors couldnt help me as they didn't find a brain tumor on the CT scan. It wasn't until I got an MRI two months later while going through all of this, that the WNT diagnosed the brain tumor. Not to mention the severe hearing loss in both ears, especially the left.

I saw the best in others and I saw the worst. My mental health suffered while waiting for care. And worst of all the doctors were somewhat dismissive of my needs. It wasn't until I saw a doctor at Duke University Medical Center, one of the most advanced medical centers in the world for skull base tumors, even able to perform operations no other medical center can, that I got real help.

A Vestibular Achwannoma has a high survival rate. Mine wasn't that big at 7mm ans some survive even larger. 

I talk a lot about it on my GoFundMe my friends made, where I post updates and on social media as well.

And yet, a part of me feels like maybe it wasn't that bad. I didn't die. I didn't end up like the others who are worse off than I am today. I felt I was dying and was even suicidal, thinking and plotting ways to off myself that would be considered an accident. I didn't want to live life with the amount of hearing loss I had, the potential for permanent dizziness, ans these tormenting symptoms to continue even after surgery (which the symptoms have since resolved sans the hearing loss).

Maybe I'm a whiner. Maybe I'm not simply updating friends and gsmiyl, but looking for attention. Maybe I shouldn't have spent my GoFundMe donations on more than just medical bills - like a dietician, additional physical therapy, and yoga lessons. All were to help me adjust to life after a brain tumor and improve my almost non-existent balance. But it wasn't specifically necessary, even if it worked.

I know what I went through was real, and nobody else's opinion on the matter has any meaning but mine. Even now, I still talk to a therapist who I've seem throughout this process. She says this is normal for many, these feelings. What I went through was real. Did someone doubt me? Yep, but nobody else sided with those people.

And yet, I sometimes wonder of the worst days of my life were really pain, agony, and loss, or simply exaggerating for help.",fear
3843,"Hey guys, I’m looking for some advice about coping with imposter syndrome surrounding my art.

I’m hoping to gain more confidence in my art in future but I want to find a healthy balance between confidence and reasonable pricing, especially as someone who has never sold art before.

I started a new job and when I joined, I had no idea that a similar counterpart for my role was also hired. “Marisa” joined a month after me in the same role. 

I was already blindsided and confused as to what I would be doing since they hired someone else for my exact role.

Overtime, we’ve gotten to known each other and I think very highly of her and actually very envious of how she talks and her experiences. She seems so smart when she talks, and always has something to say in meetings to contribute. Our executive team really likes her as well. She is just really good at her job. She also does way more than me so I feel like I am not doing anything.

Whenever I talk, I feel so stupid. I don’t sound smart. I say “yeah” and “ok” a lot. I know I’m very introverted - I don’t know why I started such an extrovert-type role. Whenever I contribute an idea, everyone shuts me down. Even our manager that we both report to sides with her all the time and mentions that them two are a team and never says anything about me as part of the team.

I just feel so stupid and feel like I don’t know anything and everyone else thinks I am stupid too. I am feeling such a heavy bout of imposter syndrome. I know I have good experiences and got hired for a reason but I cannot express myself the way I want to. I want to seem confident and talk a lot - but I don’t know what to say.

3848,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I’m in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

“You went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.”  
“You’ve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won’t make enough because of it to make that ok”

“Your almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??”

It’s the answer to the last one that makes me realize I’ve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I’ve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I’m a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn’t know I just couldn’t hack it academically, even though I’ve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn’t worked, it’s because those around me wouldn’t let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fiancé before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn’t let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream “who cares” and snap everyone around me out of it.

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",trust

3855,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

3875,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them. Sorry this is so long, most of you probably won't even get to the end but my point is: is the way I felt about being called a hero imposter syndrome?",trust
3876,"For some background, I am an engineer by degree. I moved from India to Europe at 22 to do my master's followed by a phd. I was 5 years into my PhD where I decided I could not do it. The problem was not my work but my professor who was basically gaslighting me.
I took up a job at a small company and I was happy with it even though the pay wasn't as much. I got contacted by a recruiter for a big Mnc and given that it was the company of my dreams, I immediately took up the offer. 2 yrs into the job I decided to pursue a more managerial role. My work was recognized and I got promoted to a technical manager position. It has been 4 months and I have been dealing with a lot of big bosses and colleagues in much higher up positions and with a lot more experience than I have. 
I feel I am not qualified enough to talk to them either at a technical level or at a managerial level. I overthink and keep making what I think are mistakes. I don't know what others think of me and I feel stressed out just thinking about it. I want to know if I am going in the right direction and I have scheduled a meeting with my boss regarding this. But now it scares me if he says he isn't happy with my performance. I am continually under stress and I need to know that I am not alone who continuously doubts herself.

When I was young I used to copy my friends hair styles, call their favourite colours my favourite colours and basically try and adopt the habits, interests or styles of people I admired.

Someone's I'm scared that I'm still doing this unintentionally and it takes a bit of the enjoyment out of things.

For example: My friend, Dylan, really likes unsettling and weird art videos. Like Jack Stauber or u m a m i. Before we became friends I used to just skip past these kinds of things. I was pretty indifferent towards them. But after a conversation that I had with Dylan about them, I love them. Feel almost that I have no right liking them. And that I'm doing the same thing that I used to do as a child. It makes me feel really embarrassed and ashamed and I'm constantly having to try and convince myself that Dylan's own love of these videos simply inspired mine and that Im not being pretentious.

I do this all the time, with so many things. Music. Fashion. Art.

3883,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me “there were people who did not want to employ you” and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either “I think you are an idiot” or “you are now fired”. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of “I am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...”. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn’t 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It’s silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don’t remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager’s manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I’ve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it’s ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",trust

The company, the owner, the department heads, and nearly everybody else is happy, super polite and nice, upbeat every day, Type-A, and really fucking smart. I didn't think I had any business, much less skill and social skills at all, to be working with so many people like that.

I was anxious, depressed, nearly throwing up every morning before work for months and months, and thinking I might be fired at any moment once they discovered that I was a fraud and not as smart as they thought I was at my interview.

I felt like such a fish out of water for the first year, at least, before I started to even get a little bit comfortable. Even then I only felt like I was barely holding my head above water with the knowledge that I gained of the software I had to support on a daily basis.

Every quarter, we have a full company meeting, this last one being held virtually today due to the shit going on right now. Before each quarterly meeting, everybody in my department submits a nominee from within our group to be employee of the quarter.

This morning, at our virtual meeting, it was announced that I had been chosen as Employee of the Quarter from my service department.

My job can be VERY stressful and risky and needs lots of split-second judgments sometimes. I made one, I can back it up, but it caused conflict and I was prob not 100% in the right in how I did it...which leads me to start doubting myself completely.

3909,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

I ended this year with 3.9 gpa and try to tell myself that this is proof that i belong at this uni, but immediately after i say that, i think that i only got this gpa on luck. i only got this gpa because im not a stem major and i spend most of my time on getting good grades so its not an accomplishment

a few days ago, i got accepted for a research assistant position with one of my professors. i havent been able to have a stable emotion for 5 minutes straight and feel that at any moment the prof will tell me that the email was a mistake or that she wants to fire me. im so scared to start research because im terrified that she will realize i am not as smart as my gpa shows and will despise me. i know people much smarter and accomplished than me who applied for this position and didnt get it. i dont know why i got it, it feels like some kind of sick joke- it feels like a dream or a nightmare. ive never had any research experience before this, ive literally worked only part time jobs rolling burritos or lifeguarding in order to help my family. 

i did upsell myself a little on my resume and said i knew 3 coding languages, which i do, but am terrified she will expect some crazy level of expertise in these languages and i have to say i dont know how to do something so im trying to catch up on my coding as much as possible rn on youtube...i feel horrible i dont even know",anticipation

Or if both are in the same field and in the same office (say, both are programmers and work on the same project, they check each other's codes occasionally). One is honest and gives good review, the other degrades the other persons coding skills (even if they are obviously on the same level) and eventually the downgraded person will start believing that they're really not good enough.

I wonder if this is impostor by proxy or something else like gaslighting? Maybe it's gas lighting but the result, impostor syndrome, is the same. But it fo.es by a proxy bot by themselves even if it then continues to com from themselves... is this even coherent? Do I make sense?

I feel lonely a lot of the time. It's stupid & completly self inflicted. I think no matter how lonely I feel now, it will feel worse in the future when I lose all the friends I have. So it's easier to have as few friends as possible.

Every time I get a compliment I tell them they are wrong. Because I feel bad for them having been deceived into believing something unture, and dont want them to think me a liar or feel disappointed in the future when they find out the truth. People have actually said to me ""I'm not lying"" & ""I'm not being nasty"" after compliementing me because of how I reacted!

I am scared I will lose all 3 of my people when they realise they don't actually like me. It is easier to accept that my friend of 18 years isn't going to just change her mind (although I have no clue why she continues to be my friend), but newer friendships are so emotionally exhausting! Have been friends with my online friend for a few years, & still EVERY SINGLE TIME we talk (most days) I am scared that this will be the conversation that kills our friendship, or that if I say something silly he will never speak to me again.

My husband has given up telling me why I am a likeable person or a good friend, when I am crying because someone said they like me, or called me their friend, or thanked me for always being there for them, or a customer at work said they like my hair that day, or whatever the reason.

2. i feel like i shouldn't have friends because i'm always thinking about what i don't like about a person to make me distance myself from them, i'm always the afterthought friend, i always feel like i have to put up a front for each and every person for them to like me and i'm just lying to everybody.

4. i feel like everything i do isn't enough. when i got accepted to college, the first things my mother asked me were ""on what grounds?"" ""can they take it back"" and then ""where is (name of my friend she really likes) going? medicine? omg i'm so proud of her!"" and every time my college topic comes up, she only talks about my friend and how amazing she is. my mother hasn't talked to me about college once. today, while we were taking about a trip that i'll take alone to my hometown, i told her my sister and her boyfriend would pick me up from the airport, and she said to me, ""nobody cares enough to go that far for you.""

Hi all,

I (27F) have always had ups and downs with anxiety, confidence and insecurity. I'm going through a rather difficult patch at the moment. I'm a journalist and I've just started a new job. I used to work on long form documentaries but making the switch back to daily news is really daunting.

I went through a very competitive interview process to get here, and I've always received very positive feedback on my work in every other job. So logically, I should feel like getting this job is really well-deserved.

However, the other members of the team are extremely good - intimidatingly so. There are many people here with a lot more experience than me (even the more junior members of the team) who seem to be far fuller of ideas than I am and much more vocal. They approach their work with a confidence and conviction that I can never see myself having.

I am much shyer than my coworkers and struggle to speak up in meetings. I have been trying to force myself to do this more, and even recently spoke at a public event to try and gain more confidence. It hasn't got any easier at all, and I still cringe when I hear myself speaking in front of a large group. I don't feel like my ideas are as original, creative, fully formed and well-thought out as the ones many others pitch. I spend hours researching topics I'm interested in, but I struggle to form proper stories out of my ideas and therefore don't pitch very often. I know I should arrange a meeting with my boss to talk about these issues, but I feel like they are always so busy and I don't want them to think they've made a mistake by hiring me if I highlight my insecurities.

Because I'm so intimidated by my coworkers, I feel reluctant to start conversations or even make small talk with them, even though I know I would benefit from doing this and learn a lot from them. I know it actually looks worse that I'm not taking the time to engage with them, but the thought of doing so makes me anxious.

I just feel like a great big fraud, really. I want to become a really good journalist, but I know this anxiety and lack of self-esteem is really holding me back.

I also had a friend who was anxious about getting sick and dying because of every little discomfort (hypochondriac) and it made me scared that I could have the same disorder instead of being actually sick.

3948,"I’ve always had issues with imposter syndrome but it’s never been this bad and I don’t know what to do anymore. I am in my last 3 months of graduate school where I am set to complete a dual masters degree with a dual concentration. My GPA is a 3.8, so on paper it sounds like I’m extremely intelligent in my field, but in reality I don’t even know what the day to day work life would look like for someone in my career path. I’m currently completing my Capstone for my degree and I’m struggling horribly with writing just the proposal. I have no idea how to write a sound study design and can’t wrap my head around writing all most 10 pages worth of information on a project that is still far into the future (in terms of data sources, limitations I might have, data analysis). 

When I was in the thick of my graduate curriculum I always received good grades and got things done on time, but I think I just learned how to do homework really well. For example, I was taking my degree at an accelerated rate in order to graduate sooner, so I was completing more classes than was recommended or than what my peers were. Because of this, a lot of the assigned reading/work for each class was doubled so I physically wouldn’t be able to complete all of it exactly as I should’ve, in a timely manner, while also trying to live a life and working full time. My work around was that I would skim a lot of it, and never do any of the optional or supplemental work. I would give the bare minimum of effort on assignments, in order to get an A or high B. And it worked, like I said I completed my curriculum with a high 3.8 GPA. But now… I think I really regret not reading everything word for word. I feel like I can’t even tell you what I learned. 

Now that I am almost done with my degree, which hopefully even freaking happens at this point… I have to start finding a job. I’ve been applying to 10-20 jobs almost everyday and I can’t even get someone to give me an in person interview for an entry level position in my field, and I now have THREE advanced degrees. More so, I sometimes try to imagine some of the field related questions they may ask me when I finally do land one, and I LITERALLY can’t imagine I would know ANY of the answers to anything they may ask. Not to mention, from reading the basic job descriptions I have almost no qualifications…so like why did I even put myself in this much debt for these degrees that apparently mean nothing now?

At this point, I feel like I’ll never succeed in this field, I have dread every day that I’ll horribly embarrass myself in interviews or talks with other similar professionals, and now I don’t even know if this field was for me to begin with.

I shared this info elsewhere but basically, I constantly downplay my own skills and capabilities. Always reminding myself that there is someone out there who basically surpasses me in everything I can/will do. (And yes, it does bring me down due to the accuracy of that statement.) That's not the main reason for this post.

Unlike most cases where it's usually job/hobby related. Mine is related to personality. I don't know why, I'm pretty sure I do not possess any kind of personality disorder. And I have been told repeatedly time after time again that I am a good person, but for some odd reason, my brain doesn't believe this and attempts to coerce me into believing that I am in an A-hole. Brewing the idea that I may as well expose myself as the a-hole In r/amitheasshole or r/Niceguys respectively.

No I have not done anything (to my knowledge), note worthy for a post there and yes, it's something that I constantly worry about. I'm worried that I'm secretly a disgusting incel, which is why I don't approach woman for any kind of flirting/relationship. Let alone converses with them.

I'm worried that I'm gonna upset an employee at retail because I need help with something even though that poor soul probably had to deal with borderline psychotic customers on a daily basis, if Reddit is to go by. So, I never ask.

People thank me for doing something nice and tell me how much of a good person I am, yet.....I keep thinking that they're just be nice and that they don't want to bother wasting their time  convincing me that I am actually a jerk and need to f right off.

It's been starting to hit me lately, my mom said I'm the weirdest person in the family and I often hear that I'm one of a kind but I take those statements as compliments because I appreciate being my own person but I think the awareness is making it harder to feel normal as myself.

I'm always trying to remind my coworkers to be mindful when they say mean things and I feel like a hypocrite when I do because who am I to correct them even though I make a conscious effort to be mindful. They've told me I can't change the world on my own but they also told me that I don't talk trash which is encouraging.

I can't keep my hands off of him which worries me more that he'll think it's lust when I just love him a lot and I feel a transfer of that energy when I touch him. 

It is the most confusing thing to be so sure about my connection with someone and the solidity of the relationship but to also second guess it knowing that there is no reason to. Having had a toxic relationship in the past where my tunnel vision was so strong that I glorified every flaw and let him warp my being, it's difficult not to worry I'm doing the same thing sometimes but I know I'm not but back then I would've thought the same so how can I ever know.

I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe.

However, in February I decided to start working 2 jobs and pay down a bunch of my student loan debt. I also got a job I really enjoy and may have finally found my career path. Because I'm currently so active, every new person I meet thinks I'm some sort of go-getter. 

Long version: I consider myself quite a lazy person because outside of work and exercising a bit, I mainly spend my time playing video games. I'm very introverted, so I don't go out much and meet new people very often, but I have been on a couple of online dating apps, which is where this façade started. I bring up working 2 jobs and I even take a course my current company is paying for, and everyone is really impressed not even on just the apps, but at work too. 

Without going too much into detail, I graduated university about 6 years ago, and for 5 years, I was in a very deep cycle of depression. I moved in with my mother after a big lay off and I was only paying on the interest of a few private student loans, not even making a dent in the principle balance. Late last year though, I decided enough would be enough, and earlier this year I started working a 2nd job and am able to use the money for my student loans. I got a new main job in January and the company is paying for a course for me to take to advance my career, so I'm also taking that. So yes, it seems like I'm active, and in fact I am no longer depressed at all, but I'm only active now to make up for the last 5 years of being a lazy bastard. And honestly, I'm probably going to go back to being lazy once all of my debt is done with and my course is over.

My therapist a few months ago said I may suffer from imposter syndrome (I haven’t be diagnosed with it, not sure if it’s even a diagnosable thing). I believe this to be very true and I can back it up with evidence throughout the most recent years of my life in specific. The problem I’m having is that I have proven myself to have the talents and accomplishments of a top trader (top 1% and most likely even higher) but I can’t come to acceptance with them… 

When I was younger I resold sneakers and took a starting investment of $1k up to $100k over the next 3 years. I bought one of my favorite cars and it made me so happy. I mention this as it relates to what I’m feeling now. I have all the proof of my accomplishment and skills in reselling sneakers (my car, my track record of sales, etc). Two years ago I got into trading as a long term and stable career. Right out the gate I achieved great success (just like with selling shoes) but never capitalized on it due to me making mistakes. I have the talent and reuslts based on my performance to scale up to a great $ amount just like I have with shoes but I can’t believe it to be true (Imposter feelings). 

Trading is already very hard as it is but I have proven myself to have a great long term career in this. Things are starting to work out for me now that I haven’t been making mistakes but it’s like I can’t believe the success I have in store for me despite my greats results and proof of this (just like I did when I selling sneakers when I was 15).

This internalizing has lead to countless occasions of hurting the people closest to me because of viewing the world from my skewed perspective as well as sabotaging myself and having to start over in life constantly.

So when the old feeling starting creeping up that I’m not a productive contributor to any facet of life I am in, I decided to speak up for once.

With all this, I can’t afford to “start over”, and thought maybe talking to some of these people I genuinely trust would help me achieve a different outcome this time.

The problem with this is of course, being the good people they are, they were understanding.  Or seemed understanding.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone.

People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

3981,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don’t know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I’m so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my “thing”, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can’t you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your “thing”?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I’m not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I’m saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can’t I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I’m a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking. I feel like I am just not the type to succeed. And so I’ve decided that I want to start investigating instead of feeling this pressure in my chest and trying to logically calm myself. Can someone tell me, how do I feel I’ve succeeded?",anticipation
3982,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university. The stuff with new guidelines but no updates and whenever I get an update email I tell myself I'll read it later but never do it.

I’m so glad to find this sub. I’m a new graduate, I just graduated in October. My last semester was extremely light only 2 courses so I began looking and applying for full time jobs in the summer itself. I found a remote part time job on contract that I have until this april and took it so I’d have something to do while I look for full time. My father passed away in September and I didn’t actively look for a while before or after.

Now, after a couple months of very consistent applying for probably hundreds of jobs and 3 interviews- I got a full time permanent job offer at a GREAT company, in my field too. Excellent entry level opportunity. My mom is over the moon and so are family and friends BUT.. 

The position is set to start in July and every single day I feel like I will lose it before even starting it. That I will receive an email one random day and they just take it back for no reason. My mom wanted to celebrate with friends and I refuse to. I feel like I would just have to inform everyone that I lost it. 

I don’t feel like I could possibly get an opportunity this good. Why would they pick me? Undoubtedly I have peers that are just as smart if not smarter. They obviously will realise that before July or something totally improbable like the position just being eliminated from the organisation. 

Irrationally I feel like I only got it as a small good happening to us after something so horribly painful. Like there’s a scale to balance my pain and happiness and it’s being tipped slightly.

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others.

A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

I would appreciate any perspectives. Even critical negitive ones will help me see if my problem is important or not, even though I understand it is something many go through.

This morning she was telling me that she’s basically not good enough for this role among other thing. She was also perturbed that some of the district managers that she worked with previously have not wished her good luck with the new role.

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly. Sometimes if I have a backup or another I feel more comfortable using it. What made me realize it is my laptop, the surface pro 3 I got 5 years ago I've always felt weird using it, but now that I was just given the pro 7 for Christmas I feel way more comfortable using the old one because I know if it breaks I'll have another chance. (poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

Also last night going to bed I had the thought, ""I can't believe I'm not homeless"". A huge part of my imposter syndrome rn is being mostly financially dependent on my mom and not having financial independence yet.

I think my CV it looked good in my younger days (though of course, what does ""good"" really mean?). Still, during my masters thesis I had quite the problem with anxiety -- I felt like I am basically stealing my supervisors time (a feeling, which I yet admittedly did not fully shake). No I am thinking about applying to postdocs and I feel really anxious particularly about asking for references. Like what if my former supervisors my think it me a leech? Also I am very unsure about the whole postdoc business.  


Is there a way to shake these feelings? Currently, friends and colleagues think I am ok (my advisor is actually quite positive, which makes me quite distrustful). On the other hand, it is easy to find CVs in the internet that make mine pale in comparison. Now, I know that these are biased by the way I find the CVs (basically by looking up the authors of papers I like). For me the question is, whether there is a way to estimate my own worth. In particular, in a competitive area like academia.  


Now, I know of people genuinely smarter than me and one told me that he suffered from it. Only half a decade later do I wounder if this is bringing me down all the time.

4000,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me “there were people who did not want to employ you” and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either “I think you are an idiot” or “you are now fired”. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of “I am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...”. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn’t 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It’s silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don’t remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager’s manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I’ve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it’s ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",trust

When I realized there was no way I could pass the exam. There were too many questions, too much info, & I wasn’t clicking with the material. So I asked the dr for a note explaining my anxiety so I could get more time. I’ve never used a medical condition as a crutch this way.

With the extra time I passed the exam & did fairly well. But the whole time I was getting more & more depressed, I was guessing answers & knew I was failing & didn’t know what would happen.

And a friend, who is nice to ppl, & a father, failed the exam. He deserves to be here, I don’t. This is just adding to my guilt & imposter-y feeling. If he had more time he would’ve passed, it’s just unfair.

It's surreal because the people I am working with are the best of the best and I know I don't belong here. I messed up my GPA a lot last quarter, and so it's not imposter syndrome -- just inability. As a female in a computational field, I try to tell myself not to be so doubtful because I'm making life difficult for myself as well as for other women. However, my current grades don't warrant the kind of confidence that many of my peers have --I'm just so embarrassed. I don't know whether I should continue doing this because I know I'm not comparable to my peers and being the only girl in the lab makes me feel even more humiliated. A few days ago, I started working as an undergraduate tutor, and I actually said in my introduction to students that they should ""bear with me, in case I make mistakes."" In hindsight, I feel so angry that I said that because I've never seen another tutor introduce themselves by pointing out their potential flaws or shortcomings.

It’s taken me a full 4 years to get this paper done (which seems like a while but it was hard to balance it with classes). Long story short, I’ve realized that there are a lot of mistakes in my paper: calculations, conversions, that my advisor thinks I’ve done (which i did do 2-3 years ago) and these are things I just flat-out have no idea how to do anymore. It seems like common knowledge to just tell my advisor “look, i’m really confused and I regret not asking for more help with this in the years prior. Can you simplify this because I’m just not getting it” (he’s very understanding) but i’m so fearful of disappointing him and I feel so dumb when considering asking “basic” questions because I have no idea what I need to do. Sadly, it’s not like my advisor doesn’t know I have anxiety issues and can get in my own head very easily. I’ve worked for him all through school.

I know I have to ask for help in order to get this done and I only have a bachelor’s degree so i shouldn’t beat myself up about not understanding Master’s/PhD level physics concepts but I cant help it (especially considering i’ve applied to PhD programs recently)

I just keep wondering how I got this far, graduated with multiple honors and scholarships and feel like I got so lucky with many of my achievements though on a higher level I know I worked my butt off for them.

Does anyone relate to this fear of asking for help, or have a good piece of advice they’ve learned? I would love to know how you manage your own inner negative voice!

Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr.

I'm pretty close currently - I'm a creative lead for an agency that does work for transportation clients, which can include the govt. I like the overall atmosphere but...

I've been here for 3 months now. The first big project I've had is a branding project for an organization's program. We presented concepts to the client and while they didn't completely freak out and call it OMGZ AMAZING, they were still really well received and they liked it. 

My supervisor doesn't feel it's enough. She wants them to basically freak out with joy when they see our work, because that's what they've done in the past. So much that, she got an OK from our CEO to hire an art director as a freelancer and she starts Monday. I feel pretty defeated/rejected/unworthy at this point - everything I've tried working for in this field just feels like it's been for nothing, and at this point I don't know what I'm doing being a creative anymore. I'm not good enough. 

The reason this hits me so hard is because overall I have had a hard time keeping a job for the same exact reason - I've never been enough for a company. I don't know what I can do anymore. I have never felt like I am good enough in this field, but it's the only thing I know. While my job doesn't get that I'm overloaded and don't have the bandwidth to think as strategically as they want me to, it just doesn't matter.

Think about it. For the other imposter types listed, even if internally they feel like a mess, there are still some external benefits to their internal insecurity.

1. The perfectionist will still strive for that 100%. Even if they do miss that 1%, they are still going to probably be 99% better than most people.
2. The superwoman/man will work harder than anyone else. Even if they are insecure, their efforts show up in their work and gain them respect.
3. The expert gathers every piece of information and knowledge that they can. Even if their knowledge is incomplete, they still know more than probably the average person.

But the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist""? Lord help them. And by Lord help them, I mean Lord help me LMAO.

1. The soloist is fighting a losing battle. They are trying to go it alone WHILE also trying to be perfect. We all need mentors and teachers to help us to learn things! People will think that you are arrogant because you are trying to learn things on your own. And you most likely will also fail because who can succeed without the help of others?
2. And the ""natural genius""? Oh my goodness, this is even worse! Think about it: this person (me, lmao) delusionally thinks that they can excel WHILE on minimal effort AND on their first try. They give up easily at the sign of any challenge, because that's a sign that they aren't ""good"" or ""talented"" or ""smart"" enough. Therefore, they never actually excel at anything.

I feel like the first three (perfectionist, superwomen/man, expert) are almost like ""productive"" imposters. People that feel like imposters, but at least do something about it that can somewhat productively counteract those feelings.

But the bottom two, which I unfortunately am? It's like where you feel like you are an imposter, and instead of at the very least compensating for it, you just try to hide it... by trying to go it alone so that no one can see your imperfections at least for a short while (soloist) or by only ever sticking to things that are ""easy"" so that you can pretend like you are some sort of ""natural genius"" of some sort. 

Not to say that any of these are objectively supposed to be considered as ""good."" But I guess I'm just a little bit frustrated with myself... ",trust
4035,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn’t put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn’t. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family’s and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if’s. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it’s why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I’ve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what’s looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don’t look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it’s offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don’t have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We’ll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don’t feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don’t treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven’t earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn’t earn it, that’s bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that’s where you go so ride it out. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don’t go down the dark hole there’s nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

4042,"The dictionary defines self-awareness as “knowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.” 

When you’re self-aware, you have an accurate and clear understanding of your character, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs and sense of self. You know what your life is about, you know how others perceive you and the effect you have on them.

Why does it matter?

Your level of self-awareness influences the key pillars in your life – your relationships, career, personal development and overall wellbeing.

· Self-awareness is necessary for taking control of your life. The direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and reactions. Self-awareness is the principal way of understanding and influencing these things. When you take control, you have choices.

· Self-awareness identifies un-resourceful beliefs and emotional reactions that stand in your way and gives you the power to make adjustments – personal growth.

· Self-awareness can lead to a greater understanding of past setbacks and challenges. We can conveniently dismiss our failures as bad luck or a lack of proper timing. But it’s also possible that we failed to perceive the situation, others, or ourselves accurately. It’s much easier to see the reason behind relationship, work, and other struggles when we can look at ourselves honestly.

· Self-awareness is critical for successful leadership. Leaders with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses are able to build teams that compensate those weaknesses and leverage the strengths.

· Self-awareness is the foundation for personal growth. Without it, any personal development efforts will be severely hampered – as if you’re building on sand.  
   
 

# How Can I Develop Self-Awareness?

· **Develop the habit of Noticing your thoughts.** Our minds are constantly churning through ideas and endlessly providing commentary. Becoming aware of these thoughts, and noticing the common themes gives the potential for encouraging more resourceful self-talk.

○ Notice your thinking patterns. What are you thinking when you’re feeling nervous? Bored? Interested? Walking down the street? – what does this mean for you?

○ Do you judge people and situations? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future? Do you expect the worst to happen or the best? Or do you adopt an open attitude of, “Let’s just see what happens”?

· **Notice your feelings.** What are you feeling throughout the day? What do you feel while you’re eating? Driving to work? Lying in bed? Waiting in line?

○ As you notice each emotion, question it. What am I feeling? Why? What do I need right now? How do I normally react in this situation? Is this resourceful for me? 

· **Reflect on how you deal with frustration or emotional discomfort.** ***A huge chunk of your time is spent trying to make yourself feel better.*** If you feel slightly frustrated or uncomfortable, then you may spend a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to change the situation or the others around you to resolve those negative feelings. Would id be more resourceful to develop your responses – which you can control – or try to change others – who you do not control. 

○ Do you try to control others? Do you attempt to distract yourself? Is your first instinct to leave the situation? Do you surf the internet or eat a big bowl of ice cream?

· **Consider your friendships.** Where do you meet new friends? Are most of your friendships long-term or short? When your friendships end, what is the common cause? What types of people do you prefer to be friends with? What types of people do you avoid?

· **Consider your intimate relationships.** Do you see patterns in the type of people that you’ve been involved with? What are the common positive and negative characteristics they share? Why do you think those people appealed to you?

○ What were your shortcomings in your relationships? Are you clingy? Jealous? Too focused on work? Fail to communicate your needs? Think about how you contributed to the successes and failure of your relationships.

○ Have you changed your approach from relationship to relationship, or do you continue to repeat the same patterns?

· **Keep a journal.** This is a highly effective way to learn about yourself by recording your thoughts, feelings, and experiences each day. Be sure to include your high and low points for the day.

○ Note how well you ate and slept, too. Sleep – especially changes in sleeping patterns - can elicit very valuable information about what is going on. 

○ Create a habit of writing in your journal for at least 15 minutes each day. You’ll start to notice patterns and learn a lot about yourself.

· **Reflect on your core values.** Think about and then document your core values, goals and intentions. You might be surprised by what you write. This is a great first step for understanding yourself and your beliefs.

· **Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses.** How do you know? Are you certain? Avoid jumping to conclusions. You may have always believed that you’re a hard worker, but are you? To whom are you comparing yourself? Provide yourself with proof before you make any decisions. Are you noticing any limiting beliefs – I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy?

· **What would others say about you?** Consider how your partner, children, friends, family, co-workers, and boss would describe you. What would they suggest you improve about yourself? How do you respond to thinking about what others think about you?

○ Meditate at least once each day. Spend the rest of the day paying attention to yourself, others, and your surroundings. You can develop a higher degree of self-awareness by just paying attention.

○ Question yourself throughout the day.  *“What emotions am I currently feeling and why?” “What are the people around me feeling?” ‘’what is the best use of my time right now?’’*",trust

4044,"I have a Masters in computer science from a relatively prestigious school, and I’ve received praise and awards from respected tech companies.

But… all I hear are the words of three people:


My Dad - When I got into a top program for a Ph.D in Computer Science he was only disappointed I didn’t get into MIT.  

When I placed at the top of my college class and won a faculty award for my senior project, he later criticized it saying his idea would have been better and that it didn’t go anywhere (it did, later years based their work on mine).



My Professor - I wrote a thesis for an honors program, and he was supposed to read and give feedback.  My primary professor loved it and praised me.

This other professor said he wasn’t convinced, said the entire field (unconventional computing) is a waste, and it doesn’t make sense to get a Ph.D unless you’re someone “like Hawking or Einstein”.  He himself was a Harvard grad, and his words really took a toll on me.



My Best Friend - Just regularly puts me down.. calls me ugly, never celebrates my accomplishments and criticizes me instead.  I always do my best to give him support and rarely criticize his work (the rest of the world does that enough).  

But, it feels like he needs to make me feel inferior.  One time I met some new friends, both with a “prestigious”  C.S. background, and we started a project together.  My friend immediately snapped and said “well they’re obviously smarter than you”.



I just have this constant stream of echos in my head, mostly from these three people, and it kills my confidence.

It's been haunting me ever since, and is probably the root of my Imposter Syndrome. I have this built in mechanism that shuts me down unless I'm at the top of the food chain. Next, the field of cyber security is one of immense talent, and it's honestly becoming very hard not to compare myself with my coworkers. Especially when your bonus is tied to performance and feedback. It gets to the point where my performance anxiety halts any progress I was attempting on a project. And now I'm stressing about my performance evaluations... So why did I choose this job, well it's because I want to be seen as ""the expert"", so I choose difficult jobs that force me to learn. It worked for over a decade until I've reached this point. It's like the Dilbert Principle but applied to anxiety.

I'm at the point where I'm considering taking a massive pay cut just so I don't need to perform; like a boring job fixing shitty bugs in obsolete enterprise code. 

How the hell do people grapple with this? I've been told to ignore those intrusive thoughts and instead focus on accomplishments. I've read about mindfulness. I tried not giving a fuck. But it all seems like a minor speed bump, and the IS always comes sneaking up on me.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I’ve done good. I’ve made mistakes, gotten subpar marks like everyone else but I was almost always able to pull it together when it mattered - GCSEs, A Levels, uni exams and assignments. This last year, the last year of my Bachelor’s, I seemed to be on track for a First, with me pulling myself through assignments with First-class marks.

And then I didn’t do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master’s program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It’s always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

Now I’m looking back on everything I’ve done well and it feels like a fluke, a fraud, that I was just lucky and wasn’t really worthy of the good marks and grades given to me. I’ve always been able to pull it together when it mattered but this is when it mattered the most and I didn’t do good enough.

People are saying that a 2:1 Bachelor’s is still good enough but I can’t say how much shame I’ve felt around it. Given my way I WOULDN’T be graduating right now - do you know how shit it feels to have graduation feel like a mark of shame rather than merit?!",trust

I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

4070,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",trust
4084,"My impostor syndrome really didn't kick in until I stopped isolating as per my Avoidant Personality Disorder. It began with the over-preparation for every college exam; and when I became comfortable in my ability in college, it morphed into the intense dread of getting a job in this field. And currently, I'm up to my eyeballs in that dread because the time has come. I have my job.

And that job just so happens to have me in the most toxic work environment I've yet encountered, which has supercharged my impostor syndrome far beyond its original state because the negative inner voices now have external validation. I've spend the last three months feeling doomed and inadequate; that it's only a matter of time before I'm outed and my future is permanently ruined.

Impostor syndrome affects me so badly that I become incapable of even the most basic tasks, which gives my coworkers more ammunition to fire at me, which reinforces the idea that I truthfully suck and failure is inevitable.",fear

4089,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling with intrusive and negative thought about myself for more than 4 years now and I just can’t deal with it no more. I want to reduce my symptoms but I have yet failed to do so. There is a naut in my reasoning and I need to undo but I need help.

So I consider myself pretty lucky. I have good parents, I have always done good at school during childhood. I guess I always had an underlying anxiety issue because at age 15, I could bare a break up and tried (unsuccessfully-thanks lord) to end my life. This depressive period change something in me because I started to put way more importance and attention to my grades. In college, I was often 20% above average in my class, gpa (R score) way above the mean. Yet, I always aimed to get higher, never satisfied. Always giving more than requested in evaluations, making myself almost on the verge of burn out but the adrenaline kept pushing me. In my music recital, I would cry or get mad after my performance because I made mistakes I didn’t do when rehearsing, my music teacher feeling bad for me. When I did good, I always felt awkward, putting it on chance, trying to hide/deviate the conversation.

Then last year, I got in the undergraduate program I wanted (cognitive neuroscience) and everything got worst. I’m (now doubting) aiming to enter a PhD program, so does the majority of my 500 classmates, but only 12 places are available. The teachers had to put fire under our ass : “grades are not enough”, “you need to have above 4/4.3 of gpa, get hundreds of hours in research and clinical experience, win scholarships, publish”. I got scared, but for real, but I already knew this : before even starting my program I had already contacted researcher to join their lab. Week 2 of my bachelor : I had researcher assistant position. But I felt like a total incompetent and intrude. I never been in a lab in my entire life, didn’t pass a single exam and I got it almost first shot. So that was both scary and unpleasant. When I went to ask a question on a programming class to my neuroanatomy teacher for my job, he told the entire class (250 persons) that “one of your colleagues already had a research job so everyone of you should hurry up because place at PhD are limited”. The entire class released a surprise “ahh.. omg” I was humiliated (my ears turned red), wanted to burry myself 6 feet under. But now I felt the pressure, because my classmate started to recognize me.

1 year later, I got coauthorship for an article published in A famous Journal. I don’t feel I own it : I feel like an intrude. I didn’t wrote a single line of it, I was just there to help with the analysis, put comments and correct it. I feel like it was a huge gift from the postdoc and director that mentor me. The article got accepted in first round because he did an incredible work. Not only it is rare to publish as an undergraduate : it is rare to publish it that journal and it is rare that it get accepted first round. I feel uncomfortable. I feel now the bar is set so, so high. Failure is at my door and I’m scare to disappoint them. My director wants me to prepare a presentation on my “perspective on my first redaction experience, and give tips to trainee” (when I’m the youngest trainee in the entire team). I legitimately don’t know what to say: I feel and felt like an intruder for the entire process.

My classmates and colleague relly heavily on me and seem to except that I know everything, but I don’t. My director gave me a graduate level project to take over and I’ve been freezing for 3 month because I don’t know how to manage it. I don’t even know what I want to do of my life anymore but I feel I have to act like I do, at least for being a model to my classmate that don’t stop asking me question to get to my position. but I have almost no one my age to rely on in return. Mentor already projecting me publicly growing in academia but I feel stupid and so not creative compare to them. I didn’t do my math (calculus, linear algebra) and now I feel like an handicapped student.

Everything goes so well and it feels so wrong, and I’m pissed of to feel that way because I should be grateful to have met the write persons at the write moment.",trust

4101,"Hi all,

I'm here to share my story and wondering if anyone has any advice... a long post ahead (apologies).

I moved to a new country in mid 2018 with a job in a field I wanted to be in.

Prior to my move overseas, I was doing pretty ok at my job and enjoyed it well enough to keep going everyday.  I entered into the field as a graduate and did pretty well there. My job involves analytical thinking and using numbers on a daily basis. At school, math has never been my forte and I've always felt a sense of anxiety towards it for a number of reasons (e.g shamed in front of peers, parental pressure etc.). However, when I moved overseas and got a job in the same field, things started to go downhill.

The overseas job was fundamentally similar to what I was previously doing, but much more complex and customised work. I was making errors and mistakes on basic stuff. My anxiety increased exponentially and everyday I felt like I was going to be revealed as someone who is incompetent. I did my very best and worked really hard to double, triple check my work but it was a cycle of stress and anxiety as I felt less confident and would catastrophize every situation in my head (e.g. I'm going to get fired then get deported...) Coupled with the fact that my boss was a grammar nazi and had really strong eye for detail... I lasted a year and a half before I was let go.  Self sabotage much!

(I also have to note that my errors never led to any projects fallen apart, nor did we loose any clients over my work. It was the small things that added up to the whole.)

It was a tough time because I felt like an absolute failure. My boss and my colleagues had finally discovered the ""truth"" about me...

I've been lucky to get a job relatively quickly since then as I was already looking for other roles before I was let go, but feel like the situation could end up similarly if I don't change and overcome this ASAP. I've already found myself making a few simple errors and this has triggered some anxiety again.

I'm working through some parts of it through a therapist (there's a host of other issues relating to self confidence and childhood trauma which are all connected), but not sure if I can financially sustain it in the long run.

There are a few things I have been working on to try and manage and stay in control.  For example, I'm actively trying to improve my mathematical ability regularly, keep a check list of 'must-dos', exercising regularly to manage my thoughts. Since going into the new job I've tried my best do things differently to what I did before even on simple tasks. I've told my self that it's my 'system of working' that's not working - not a fundamental judgement of my ability and self.

What I do enjoy about the job is that it gives me experience to work on interesting projects and have an impact.

My plan is to stay for a minimum of one year in this new role while I try to find something else.  At the end, perhaps I'm just not suited to this job... Or am I just having a hard time letting go? Am I really an imposter?

Any thoughts or advice to manage all of this? :) It would be really welcomed and appreciated!",trust
4103,"Please tell me I’m not only one who’s walking a tightrope with this. I’m trying to temper these thoughts of being an imposter, but as we spend more days confined and distanced for bosses and co-workers I can’t help but have different things “set me off”.

For example, when I don’t hear anything from my boss on where a PowerPoint deck stands that was supposedly due today I start freaking out thinking I’ve been left out of the loop. One part of me wants to think think no news is good news, but another part thinks he’s figured out I’m not contributing anything so he cuts me out of the chain of communication.

It’s tough times for everyone at the moment so I try not to reach out too much to others to gather “facts” to dispute my fears, but in the meantime I’m driving myself nuts. I want to use the time more productively than just worrying. Part of me would even like to say if I’m out of job - so be it - start working on enhancing other skills so I’m ready for the next steps....but I can’t get past this.

Despite this I’m constantly plagued by not feeling good enough or in fear of making a mistake. The biggest anxiety is feeling like I don’t have the knowledge or skills to help a patient like they need, and not doing good enough or working hard enough for them.

Now that I'm in a pretty competitive grad program as an international student and I'm over halfway through the entire process. I'm realizing that me excusing that feeling in undergrad was just covering up the dread that no matter what I do, I will never be good enough.

I just feel like I took information from organic chemistry books and websites and that I don't actually deserve any credit because if I hadn't had resources I wouldn't have been able to have done it. It's like I believe that if I didn't just *know* something without having to research it first that I don't really know it at all, even if I made sure I understood everything before I wrote about it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it. I just feel like I'm not actually an intelligent individual and I'm just really good at pretending to be. I look at other people who're graduating from the same course as me and think they must know more than me or they must actually deserve it compared to what I've been doing.

The whole time, feeling like I was gonna be exposed, that my district wasn't good enough, that these smarter more intelligent kids would find me out. I capitulated. After that, my dad got drunk, told me I wasted his money and I never played it again. To this day.

And that's been a theme for me ever since. Since the age of 15. Had a bad bout of depression that seemed to come from nowhere, got into drugs and such, meth, codeine and self destruction. Got lucky, studied hard and went to college and now I'm 2 years clean.

But I'm still suffering the same thing. I no longer have the confidence to speak in a group of people, I always fear that they will remark something true about me. Figure me out before I finish.

It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

Where I want to get at is that I feel like I ended up here by sheer miracle or by a whim of fate. If I have to be honest, I get to understand the concepts that I work on, but I feel that sometimes it is more difficult for me than others.

4120,"Quick, who is your favorite author?

One of my favorite authors right now is Michael Wickett. He's an accomplished Nightingale-Conant motivational speaker and author. His book, ***It's All Within Your Reach*** is one of the best I've ever read.

I hold him in high regard because of that book.

Most, if not all of us, feel the same way when it comes to authors. Statistically speaking, about 80 percent of the American population wants to write a book, but so few embark on this journey. If I had to guess, I would probably say that many people do not believe they have what it takes to write a book, which, at the root is simply fear. But, I once heard Les Brown say, “When your why is big enough, you will find you how.”

I’m going to lay out 10 reasons why you should write a book and maybe, just maybe after you read them, you will find you how, and if not, I promise to help you.

## Reason #1: A book is an instant confidence booster

As I mentioned at the outset, how do you normally feel about authors? Do you treat them differently from the average person? What sort of impression do you get when you're introduced to an author?

When people perceive you in a high and elevated way, you begin to feel better about yourself. It’s an instant confidence booster. Most people treat authors as celebrities. And imagine if your book hits Amazon's #1 Best-Seller Status. What would that do to your confidence and self-esteem?

I know I felt great when mine hit that status. Not in a prideful or boastful way, but just proud of myself and what I’ve accomplished since the death of my mom. I know she would be proud of me as well.

## Reason #2: A book allows you to see your value and potential

Author John Maxwell said, “Many people fail to grow and reach their potential because of low self-esteem.”

When I was depressed and contemplating suicide, my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I could not see any value or worth in my life. But I was motivated by the thought of a postage stamp and so I began to add value to my life, first by exchanging my negative thinking for more positive ones, I began to exercise, eat healthier and start back fellowshipping with my congregation.

When I began to write, I learned to get out of my head and to see my real potential and value as a human being. If you don’t realize you have genuine value or that you're worth investing in, then you’ll never put in the time or effort required to grow.

One of my favorite motivational speakers Zig Ziglar said, “It’s impossible to consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with how we see ourselves. We can positively do very few things if we feel negative about ourselves.”

I know for a fact, that every aspect of our lives is directly impacted by the way we see ourselves. When you write and pour out your heart onto paper, you see how far you’ve gotten in life, and all that you've accomplished.

## Reason #3: Writing a book is an opportunity for self-reflection

Have you ever gone to therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. Going to therapy helped me cope with being sexually molested as a young girl. Well, I get that same type of help every time I sit down to write. Writing allows you to dig deep within yourself. You are alone and vulnerable and you're able to work things out on paper that you can’t do when they stay locked up in your head.

Writing forces you to reflect on your life. Most of the time, when we take the time to self-reflect, we see patterns that we need to change and habits we need to develop.

When I was in the fifth grade, my amazing teacher, Mrs. Battle brought a snake into the classroom and we had the privilege of seeing the snake shed its skin. It was the absolute most captivating thing I’d seen at that time. When I write, I also see myself shedding my old skin, my old thinking, and my old dishonoring ways for a newer, better version of me.

Writing has allowed me to change my life and the byproduct of that is I’ve changed the way I think about myself. I no longer see myself as a victim. I am strong and unbreakable. By the way, so are you.

Our lives are so hectic. Learning to pause allows growth to catch up to you.

## Reason #4: Writing a book allows you to flex your brain power

Did you know that our brains weigh about three pounds? It is such a small organ, yet it packs a punch. When you write, even when you're writing your own story, inevitably you will have to do some research, whether that be interviewing your family members or hopping onto Google to get some facts or now, AI ChatGPT.

Our brains are muscles. Just like any muscle it needs to be flexed or it will atrophy. Writing allows you to flex your brain. When you step outside of your comfort zone you give yourself a chance to explore new things about yourself. One new point discovered can lead to other points and you never know where that can take you. I’ve learned that to be a success, you first have to think it and the only way you start to think it is, either you change or something in your life forces you to change.

Nothing in life remains the same forever.

Writing helps you to determine your future. You can write your ticket in life or continually allow someone else to force you to write theirs. Stop thinking in terms of “Can I” and start thinking in terms of “How Can I.”

“How Can I” puts a different spin on things. It’s the beginning of a high-value question that prompts you to figure it out. Start asking the right questions and your brain will begin to give you better answers.

## Reason #5: A book is an ideal way to create side-hustle income

Most people that I come into contact with would love to someday work for themselves, whether it's for financial freedom or just because they want to spend more time at home with their family.

When you write a book and you get the title of #1 best-selling author attached to you, people are going to take notice.

Published authors are considered experts and authorities in their field. If you had a book, do you think you could send that book to a business prospect? How do you think you would be perceived by that person? Would it be difficult to land that contract? I don’t think so.

Writing a book positions you as an authority. This fact can help you sell more products and services which will ultimately impact your bottom line.

Would you like to earn more money just by writing a book?

That would be a yes for me too.

Just think, what if you were allowed to get paid for sharing with other people information you already know?

Now, perhaps unlike at any other time in history, if you possess knowledge that other people would be willing to pay for, you can start making money, with little or no startup costs, especially with the help of AI.

Teaching online grants you the freedom to still work a day job yet generate side-hustle income. Today, it’s a real possibility to even make just as much money while you're asleep as when you're awake, thanks to the power of the Internet and AI.

You have the opportunity to teach and share what you're most passionate about with large audiences. Would you like to share what you love and be paid for doing so?

So now are you beginning to see how finally earning what you’re worth by sharing your knowledge and expertise with others would help boost your self-confidence and self-esteem?

## Reason #6: A book will help you get over your fears, even your fear of public speaking

Have you ever noticed that authors are usually asked to speak at conferences or seminars? Well, my friend, the same will be true for you. I know, but you’re afraid of speaking, right?

Well, the only way to face any fear is to stand up to it. We overcome our fears by doing the thing that we fear. Here are three other ways to overcome fear:

* Define your fear. When we face new situations in life, we normally imagine the worst-case scenario. But, did you know that you can dramatically shrink your fears by simply putting them into words on a piece of paper? See how writing helps you to slay fear.
* Accept the challenges that fear presents to you. Instead of shrinking back and giving fear the upper hand, accept fear as a normal part and life and act despite it. A great tool from author and speaker Mel Robbins of The 5 Second Rule, really works. Try it. When you want to do something, just count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and then do the thing that you fear. Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Do one thing every day that scares you.”
* Think of the benefits of acting in the face of your fear. Think of what it will do for your self-esteem and self-confidence. A good exercise is to physically write down the benefits you will gain by forging ahead. The thing to remember is that every decision you make is helping to form the person you are becoming. Do you want your fear to define you or do you want to take that scary risk and come off the victor?

## Reason #7: A book will help you be more productive by raising your standards

Do you find that you are easily distracted and not being as productive as you can be? Well, writing a book during a challenge will not only help you with your productivity it will also help you with developing discipline, determination and just plain grit.

When you write a book, it’s just you, the blank slate, and now AI. Writing helps you remain singularly focused on the task at hand. It is an exercise in discipline and time management. If you stick to it, your determination will give way to a beautiful masterpiece. And no, it doesn’t have to take months anymore, it can take a weekend. I will show you how to write 10 books in 30 days.

Let me ask you a question, what's the difference between something you should do and something you absolutely must do?

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, “The things easy to do are also easy not to do.” In other words, the things you should do are things that are easy not to do and so you don’t do them. Some of these things are:

I should eat healthier.

I should exercise more.

I should treat my spouse with respect.

But when you absolutely must do something, as if your life depended on it, there is a shift and change in you. If eating healthier meant you would live or die, then you most likely would do it. The same with exercise and treating your spouse with respect, if your life depended on it, you would make the necessary changes.

When you raise your standards and turn “should” into “must,” you are making an inner shift to take control over the quality of your life. Any area in which you are not getting what you want is because you haven’t raised your standards.

According to Tony Robbins, “Most people, if they look at how they are living their lives today, will find that their identity is based on a set of standards and a set of beliefs they created 10, 20, 30 or more years ago. Many of us made decisions when we were kids about what to believe, what we are capable of, and who we are as a person, and that became the glass ceiling that controls us. But are you the same person you were back then? Are you the same person you were even a year ago?”

I’m just going to say it, you have to demand excellence from yourself. Don’t be mediocre. Be world-class. Don’t settle for the status quo, be relentless. Pursue excellence. “People are rewarded in public for what they’ve practiced for years in private,” said Tony Robbins. Never ever give up. Raise your standards. Writing will help.

## Reason #8: A book will help you develop bullet-proof habits

To complete your book, you have to have good habits, otherwise, you’ll never get it done.

In 2008, after my mom died of colon and liver cancer, a few years later, I developed the habit of getting up at 4 a.m. and going to the gym. That habit has helped and sustained me all these years. I knew I had to do something to get my mind out of the loop of negativity. I knew I had to physically move my body because where my focus goes, energy flows.

With that said, I started researching other high achievers and came across Brendon Burchard. Brendon has been studying high achievers for over 20 years and the biggest secret he has learned when it comes to habits is “trigger moments.”

In essence, trigger moments are cues that remind you to activate your intentions or habits.

I use my iPhone to create my trigger moments. A lot of people underutilize this great feature on their iPhones. Right now, I want you to take your “Clock” then hit “Alarm” and then add your alarm time. Then under “Label” write out your goal – the same one you have a picture of on your board. Press “Save”. Repeat this step three times for each of your goals. So from now on, every day at that time, you’ll be reminded to accomplish your goals. This is how you attack from all sides. You have the vision board, you have the alarm and now let’s move on to tip number three.

My all-time favorite bullet-proof habit device is pen and paper. When we track what we do, things get done. As an example, I started using my Apple Watch to track how many steps I take in a day. Before I had this device, I never walked 10,000 steps, but now that I track it, I make sure I do it every day. The same is true with any habit you form. When you write it down and track it, you will see the needle move, your results will encourage you to continue going. This helps to build momentum and you will become unstoppable. Writing has a funny way of doing that.

## Reason #9: A book helps boost your self-esteem and allows you to expect more out of life

Scientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But today, they’re learning more and more that we respond to what the brain expects to happen next.

Neuropsychologists call it the expectancy theory. Basically, through a lifetime’s worth of events, our brains learn what to expect next – even if it does not happen. And because our brain expects something will happen a certain way, we often achieve exactly what we anticipate.

Do you see the dilemma?

If you don’t expect much to happen in your life, then, most likely it won’t. But if you do expect something great to occur, it most likely will. The difference is that you have to believe it will happen to you.

But how do you get that belief?

Simply put, you need to build your confidence.

**Confidence is built through action.**

A great start is simply writing down on a piece of paper, what it is that you want and expect out of life. When you put into words what you are thinking in your head, it becomes real. You now have a way to make a plan and start seeing some forward movement in your life.

In a talk at TEDx San Francisco, Mel Robbins, self-help author of the book, The 5 Second Rule, mentioned that scientists estimate the probability of your being born at about one in 400 trillion.

Do you know what that means?

It means you are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal pride. You are extraordinary. There has never been anyone exactly like you in all history of mankind on the earth. You have amazing untapped talents and abilities that, when properly directed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want or dream of.

In essence, your very existence proves you are a miracle. So start acting like the miracle you are!

In a CD by Earl Nightingale, titled, The Strangest Secret, he says, “You become what you think about.” So what are you thinking? What are you constantly feeding your mind on? Your mistakes or your accomplishments?

Your thoughts trigger images and pictures and the emotions that go with them. These images then trigger your attitudes and actions. Therefore, if you think about success, you will feel strong and competent, but when you think about your mistakes, you will inevitably feel sad and weak.

We attract into our lives that which we think about. Whatever our dominant thoughts are, that is what will show up for us in our lives. To have more self-esteem you need to think the thoughts you would be thinking if you were already achieving your goal. Writing is a great place to start.

## Reason #10: A book helps you create and leave a legacy for your friends and loved ones

When my mom died, I wished she would’ve written a book, just a story about every aspect of her life that I failed to ask about. She was an extraordinary woman that I didn’t have enough time with. I do however have a few of her songs. She was an amazing songwriter, and that’s where I get my ability to write. Thanks, mom.

When we leave this earth, a few mementos and memories are all we have left of our loved ones. What if you had more? What if you had a book that detailed the lives of your mom, dad, grandparents and more? What if you left that to your children and relatives? How would they feel? How proud would they be? Could it perhaps encourage them to confidently go after their hopes and dreams?

I believe writing a book helps create your legacy. In our digital age, there's no telling who else will be touched and inspired by your thoughts and words. At the outset, I asked who was your favorite author or writer, what if they never wrote down that very thing that inspired you?

I believe we not only owe it to ourselves to write a book, but we owe it to the universe and the generations coming behind us. Do what author Steven Pressfield suggests in his book, The War of Art. In the last pages of his book, he says that if you don’t do the thing you were meant to do, you, not only hurt yourself, you hurt the planet. He says, **“Don’t cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you got.”**",trust
4121,"I have a Masters in computer science from a relatively prestigious school, and I’ve received praise and awards from respected tech companies.

But… all I hear are the words of three people:


My Dad - When I got into a top program for a Ph.D in Computer Science he was only disappointed I didn’t get into MIT.  

When I placed at the top of my college class and won a faculty award for my senior project, he later criticized it saying his idea would have been better and that it didn’t go anywhere (it did, later years based their work on mine).



My Professor - I wrote a thesis for an honors program, and he was supposed to read and give feedback.  My primary professor loved it and praised me.

This other professor said he wasn’t convinced, said the entire field (unconventional computing) is a waste, and it doesn’t make sense to get a Ph.D unless you’re someone “like Hawking or Einstein”.  He himself was a Harvard grad, and his words really took a toll on me.



My Best Friend - Just regularly puts me down.. calls me ugly, never celebrates my accomplishments and criticizes me instead.  I always do my best to give him support and rarely criticize his work (the rest of the world does that enough).  

But, it feels like he needs to make me feel inferior.  One time I met some new friends, both with a “prestigious”  C.S. background, and we started a project together.  My friend immediately snapped and said “well they’re obviously smarter than you”.



I just have this constant stream of echos in my head, mostly from these three people, and it kills my confidence.

But, what if they’re right?  Should I thank them for stopping me from pursuing my dreams with more confidence?

4122,"I've been struggling with imposter syndrome my whole life, I am not sure how I got through my Bachelors and Masters studies in engineering, I have 5 years of work experience in research and development and two months ago I defended my doctoral thesis. Right after this doctoral exam I got some very uplifting feedback from one of the professors saying that I impressed him with being able to answer all of his questions - and it felt like for the first time in my life, I had overcome my imposter syndrome. But, I had a job interview yesterday at my dream workplace and I've been crying for hours since. The head of r&d was there together with two section managers, one of them had interviewed me three months ago and initiated this second interview. He warned me on the phone that the head of r&d was going to put me under a lot of pressure with his questions to test me, and that I should not be intimidated by it. During the interview, he asked me so many questions within my field of research, and I just couldn't answer them, because I am embarassingly bad at remembering formulas. I regularly look them up because I simply can't remember even the basic stuff. Stuff like, what is mechanical power? And he could find all my weak spots and was so arrogant, sadistic even, and now I am questioning myself, how did I even end up getting a doctorate in engineering? And the other two interviewing me were so nice, they never would have tested me this way but now they heard how I can't answer high school level physics questions. I am not sure how I can confidently resume my work in engineering without feeling like everyone knows I'm a fraud. I worked so hard but always felt like trying to hide that I actually only know just enough to not get exposed.

I feel stupid even though I'm predicted mostly As and A*s. Just typing that statement makes me feel stupid, as I think that my good grades should prove to me that im not stupid, so I shouldn't be suffering from imposter syndrome.
Also, I study by doing past papers, so I have to mark them myself. However, there are two problems with this. I usually have to stop marking half way through the paper because I'm too scared of what the end score will be that I feel like I can't keep marking to find out. I know that I might get a good score but I'm too scared of getting a bad score so I can't keep marking it.
Another problem is that if an answer is incorrect, sometimes I have to mark it correct just to keep a good score, even though getting that question wrong doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to get a bad score overall. This makes me feel bad because I'm lying, yet I can't seem to stop doing these things.

4137,"Not sure if this fits in this subreddit, but here we go lol. Short version: I am lazy by nature. However, in February I decided to start working 2 jobs and pay down a bunch of my student loan debt. I also got a job I really enjoy and may have finally found my career path. Because I'm currently so active, every new person I meet thinks I'm some sort of go-getter. 

Long version: I consider myself quite a lazy person because outside of work and exercising a bit, I mainly spend my time playing video games. I'm very introverted, so I don't go out much and meet new people very often, but I have been on a couple of online dating apps, which is where this façade started. I bring up working 2 jobs and I even take a course my current company is paying for, and everyone is really impressed not even on just the apps, but at work too. 

Without going too much into detail, I graduated university about 6 years ago, and for 5 years, I was in a very deep cycle of depression. I moved in with my mother after a big lay off and I was only paying on the interest of a few private student loans, not even making a dent in the principle balance. Late last year though, I decided enough would be enough, and earlier this year I started working a 2nd job and am able to use the money for my student loans. I got a new main job in January and the company is paying for a course for me to take to advance my career, so I'm also taking that. So yes, it seems like I'm active, and in fact I am no longer depressed at all, but I'm only active now to make up for the last 5 years of being a lazy bastard. And honestly, I'm probably going to go back to being lazy once all of my debt is done with and my course is over.

4140,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I’m in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

“You went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.”  
“You’ve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won’t make enough because of it to make that ok”

“Your almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??”

It’s the answer to the last one that makes me realize I’ve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I’ve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I’m a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn’t know I just couldn’t hack it academically, even though I’ve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn’t worked, it’s because those around me wouldn’t let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fiancé before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn’t let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

I'll even throw in the anxiety I have about getting there on time. Call time is 6 am, and I live an hour away with my mom. Waking up at 4:30-4:45 is just something I'm unfamiliar with, and I'm worried I can't do it. I've been taking melatonin supplements (in gummies) about an hour earlier and earlier for the past few days, and it definitely has made me sleepier. I fell asleep around 11; now it's 3:30 am and I can't fall asleep again. Trying but I've been up for about an hour. 

I feel like I'm going to be fired before I even get comfortable. I'm so worried I can't do any of this but I want to still try. I just feel like I'm so out of my wheelhouse and I don't understand why - this position was (literally) custom-made for me so I could fit in.

I've never done that in my life. I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing. I don't even know where to start. My manager looks at me like I'm a moron and says ""all you have to do is pick a date and determine exactly how we're going to do this"". Is that supposed to be simple? It doesn't sound simple. Was there some sort of class on this that I missed? 

I get told to look after my mental health and prioritize my work. However, when I tried doing that I was very publicly chewed out over something that, in my mind, is such a low priority item that it doesn't make sense to stress about it. Every time I make those sorts of calls, I get ripped a new asshole. Honestly I feel like some fucked up weirdo because I don't think the same, or communicate the same way as the rest of them. 

Often times what I say is misunderstood even though I think I'm being perfectly clear. I'm ridiculously insecure about how I speak and write because people don't seem to understand me. It's gotten to the point where I sometimes have other people (outside of work) read over what I'm going to say because I'm not confident that I can express myself in a way that my coworkers will understand. It's not an actual language barrier. We're all native English speakers, but sometimes it really doesn't feel that way. 

I feel like I suddenly woke up, and here I was in this role that I have no idea how to handle. I don't know what I'm doing and management can see me cracking under pressure. The way they talk, it's like I'm supposed to just know certain things. Was someone supposed to teach me? Are these things that everyone just knows? I feel like a dumb ass for even asking.

4158,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them.

And currently, I'm up to my eyeballs in that dread because the time has come. I have my job.

And that job just so happens to have me in the most toxic work environment I've yet encountered, which has supercharged my impostor syndrome far beyond its original state because the negative inner voices now have external validation. I've spend the last three months feeling doomed and inadequate; that it's only a matter of time before I'm outed and my future is permanently ruined.

But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.
* The usual imposter stuff--""everyone at work finds me annoying/doesn't want to work with me, I don't belong there,"" etc. etc. etc.

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"".

It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter. I had nightmares very very often and would wake up at like 4 or 5 AM to edit group presentations just so i wouldn't let other people down. 

In college, it's a lot better since people can't come over and what not and are somewhat more mature. But, now that I am an upperclassman, I feel an immense pressure to go into IB/Finance. I received some Bulge Bracket firm interviews and even made it to final round, but didn't get the summer internship. I felt like I was a failure to my family and to myself and to the expectations of my colleagues in college. I don't know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel that IB/finance is meant for the rich and that they ovviously have an upper hand while I have to fight to get myself a position.

My clients are very pleased and impressed with my work also.

Do I have imposter syndrome or am I the only one realizing I am not that brilliant?

4198,"The feeling of being an imposter in me comes from the fact that I'm using skills from a field in which I'm not an expert. I come from an accounting background but I've used artificial intelligence techniques to solve a problem in the accounting field. 

I'm completing my Ph.D. in a couple of months and during these years I've also founded a start-up with my supervisors and other partners selling the output of this research. Things are going pretty well I'd say: I've won awards for my research and the company is increasing revenues and has attracted venture capital funds. 

The problem is: I'm afraid that everything I've done is wrong. I'm terrified that at some point in time, everyone will figure out that my research has a weak spot that makes it useless. The point is that I'm aware that there are some objective problems in the algorithms I make, so in a sense, I really am an Imposter, It's not just me who created a distorted idea of myself. 

And here comes my question: is there always a part of truth in our idea of being a fraud? Or is it just in my case, which is why it makes it so hard for me to overcome it?

I was able to apply to a job in a very ideal education setting, in a position I never had the chance at acquiring before graduation, and was asked to an interview. I am qualified. I can’t wrap my head around that. I’ve felt severe anxiety since accepting the interview invitation. Not excitement or aspiration. I have no control over this emotion (or lack thereof). I cannot mentally accept I’ve accomplished this goal. 

My degree was conferred last month, but my *physical* diploma came in the mail today. Rather than feeling excitement, I cried. They weren’t tears of joy. 

I don’t believe in myself. It isn’t lack of confidence, because I will fill your ear with information on child development and the knowledge I’ve gained - it’s the reality that I’ve gained the degree, I’ve broken a generational cycle, I’v given myself the opportunity to work in a field I love, forever… and am going to continue this education to make the biggest impact on childrens’ lives that I am able. 

I’m excited for that. I am proud of that.

But it still seems like a distant dream I’ll never actually accomplish and I’m faking my way through being a professional.

One our wedding day…

At first that made me feel validated. I'm so glad that this sub exists and that the people here seem nice and supportive of each other. It's reassuring. It's also terrifying to know for sure that this isn't all in my head and I may be doomed to repeat this destructive cycle forever. I'm getting older. I can't keep destroying everything and rebuilding. I'm getting too old for it. Everyone understood when I was 20, a new parent, still finding myself. I know the fears are still there. I'm still terrified that I'm a complete fraud. I know that someday, any day now, people will realize that I never knew anything or even knew what I was doing as I trained others.

I grew up poor in a small town with 3 bipolar siblings and a bipolar father. None of my siblings graduated from high school. All 3 went to rehab in some capacity. Only one isn’t supported by someone else right now. Suffice to say it was rough growing up and I was lumped in with them as never being expected to amount to much.

Fast forward- I graduated top of my class in high school. Via scholarship, a full time job, and student loans I went to a local state school and received my degree cum laude. Landed a great job and a year ago purchased a house with my wife and two dogs.

Today, I went with a colleague to a local country club his family has been a part of for generations. He’s sponsoring me to become a member.

I was in a really competitive high school a few years back, and actually managed to get great grades but was seen as the “smart kid” and my friends and teachers judged me a lot if I wasn’t getting into a prestigious program or school or if I did less well on tests which we had every week, and my mental health was really bad as a result. A lot of my friends had really toxic or abusive relationships (platonic romantic familial) and always leveraged off success as their defining “I’m doing better” kind of moment, and it compelled me to do the same even though it was destroying me. Fast forward and I’ve graduated a long time ago and no longer talk to anyone there. 

I’ve noticed that my imposter syndrome has gotten so bad and ironically manifests in little white lies. For example, I’ve been telling people that I got into X university when they ask but decided not to go; but the truth is I didn’t even apply there. I hate how easily little lies like this slip out of my mouth even when meeting new people when they ask, and I really want to stop even though these lies have no effect on serious aspects of my life :( yesterday I met someone new and this slipped out yet again, and it just bothers me so much. 

I go to a great college now that I worked my ass off to get into, but I feel like a Personality Imposter if that makes sense, and I’m surrounded by all these super talented people who are really passionate and collaborative and the brightest people in their countries etc. it really sucks that I simultaneously want to celebrate my successes which I know are valid but it feels like my whole life they were nothing compared to others.

4219,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you’re succeeding, even if you “don’t have the skills,” it’s the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You’re succeeding. It’s the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that’s who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It’s hard to tell internally whether you’re funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You’re not a good judge of that. You’re on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people’s actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it’s so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn’t be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There’s no downside. Even if you don’t “need” it or supposedly don’t “deserve” it, it doesn’t matter, because it’s a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you’ll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don’t know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I’ll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I’ve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I’ve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there’s a more tangible motivator- ‘I really want to have a good day, and it’s statistically much more likely if I’m productive.’ Try it if you’d like. Idk. I didn’t keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain’t real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it’s happening, that’s a fantastic help. It’s even better when/if you’re able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I’m rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you’ll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful. ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others. I have hesitated to share my thoughts here for fear of being insensitive to others that need more assistance. I appologize in advance if I offend anyone, know that I didnt have malicious intentions. A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

I often get nervous during my lessons that students feel I’m wasting their time, but they come back from week to week. 

As an audio engineer I also started in 2018. I did not have a ton of experience, so I charged a small fee and did the best I could. I did NOT go to school to become an audio engineer, but decided to do it after college. I’ve took an intensive course helping me to feel more confident in my tracking, editing, and mixing abilities, as well as joining an online cohort for 6 months to get feedback on my work. I’ve put in time and I’ve had the opportunity to work with some great clients... but I am going to be working with a group signed to Warner Bros. and I just feel like I’m not worthy. I forced myself to take the opportunity, but I am really nervous about it. I am also working on an album for a vocal band right now and feel like I’m not doing them justice, despite saying they’re loving the product thus far. 

I try not to let my feelings of being a fraud interfere with my life and the business I’ve built for myself... and I try to push myself to take opportunities even if I’m not comfortable with it...  but I know in my heart of hearts that my feelings are affecting my ability to do my best work and have periodically paralyzed me with fear. Words of encouragement and helpful suggestions would be appreciated.",trust
4235,"Imposter syndrome is something I’ve dealt with ever since I started my Master’s program. I never thought I belonged because I just didn’t feel as though my intelligence compared to that of my classmates. I struggled a lot in the beginning and I still question whether or not I passed my comprehensive exams sufficiently to actually deserve my degree. 

Now I luckily do have a nice job, but I feel like I was only hired as a second choice because their first choice backed out last minute (they had a PhD). I always feel bad when I don’t dedicate the time I want to this job because I’m busy with various personal changes currently (moving, adjusting, quitting an old job, etc.). 

I just feel guilty even if I take time off to take care of myself because I feel like there’s more I could be doing. I feel like I mess up a lot with the technology and question if I’m actually meant to be at this job. I’m worried I won’t live up to the expectations even though I had a meeting with a colleague the other day and she didn’t express any serious concern with how I was doing. 

I don’t know. I just wish this constant second guessing would go away and that I didn’t need to validate my experiences and intelligence constantly because it’s a battle I face in my own head. The second guessing leads to a lack of motivation because I don’t feel good enough then it becomes a viscous cycle of feeling inadequate then putting things off because I don’t trust my abilities enough.

4237,"I have struggled with imposter syndrome since joining a prestigious academic engineering oriented program (where I earned 52 college credits) at my high school 4 years ago. I didn’t look like the nerdy boys (i am female) who also made it in, and I sure didn’t spend my free time doing science research since I was 5 years old like them. These guys were natural born NERDS and I am not. I didn’t even know I wanted to be an engineer and I felt so out of place, but I stayed in the program (even got an A in my Calc 2 class) with a 67% attrition rate. 

I graduated high school and am now about to begin college classes that scare the living shit out of me, and the confidence that I thought I would get from such success in high school is fading. I’ll list out my courses for this fall semester (online classes because of COVID): Introduction to materials science engineering, Calculus 3, logic and computing devices ( and a lab that goes along with that class), electrical engineering (and a lab that goes along with that class too), and Biology for bioengineers. 

The fear that I am not cut out to be an engineer has manifested in my brain for too long.

 My bf says “that’s what school is for — to train yourself for the career you want”, but my immediate reply to him is that “school, for me, is to figure out that I am not good enough ”. 

I don’t have any rational reason as to why I am not good enough to be an engineering, but I really truly do feel like I am not good enough.

4258,"Sometimes it feels like my actions are geared, all of the time, to prove my imposter syndrome right. I applied for a job, genuinely believing I wouldn't receive an invitation to interview. I couldn't sleep the night I applied because I was humiliated at the thought of someone reading my C.V. To my surprise I got a call to interview. Shortly after that call, I told myself that they had already chosen another candidate for the job, and my invitation for interview was only because they had to fulfil a certain quota of interviewees. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well after that either.

Anyway, I performed poorly in my interview today and I didn't get the job. What do you know, my imposter syndrome was right all along. Running narratives like: it was silly of me to apply in the first place, why did I think I would've gotten this anyway, of course they had someone else in mind, I'm not skilled at interviewing so why would I even bother. I remember beforehand sitting in the interview waiting room thinking it's not too late for me to run away, cancel the interview, save the shame. 

What is this (imposter syndrome) about? Is it a perverse sense of self-preservation? Never fully committing to believing in myself, because the fall from grace would be too great? Feeling like I have to run harmful stories about myself, so that I can 'get in' before any threat enters? It doesn't work though. I still feel a bit upset despite 'expecting failure' - maybe because I realise that the way I treat myself is unfair, and ultimately doesn't get me anywhere.

Still, things I'm proud of (because fuck you imposter syndrome):

* I proved I can get to interview stage, gap in C.V. be damned 
* I can get through an interview, maybe not \*successfully\*. But the world didn't end. I'm alive. I'm here. The embarrassment of trying (& trying & failing & trying) won't kill me.

4263,"I’ll try to make this quick. I’m a 20 year old birth doula. If you don’t know what that means, it’s a female-only non-medical support career for women giving birth. I’m trained in physical comfort measures, methods such as hypnobirthing, mediation/emotional support, and advocacy for my clients’ decisions about their labor and birth.

This is a field that has just recently started to grow in popularity, and despite how simple it may sound, certification is a long, hard process. I’m extremely passionate about the importance of birth and how the idea of it has been corrupted to seem like a medical emergency in every scenario, and modern hospitals routinely abuse mothers in labor. My desire to change this has kept me going for 2 years. I’m completely trained, yet still uncertified due to the last steps being hands-on experience among other things. The pandemic has kept doulas out of hospitals, making it extremely difficult to find clients for my 3 certifying births, especially as a brand new doula. 

Recently, I’ve taken some steps that have finally led 3 clients to contact me. I’m aware that all three are mostly interested in my low fee, which is less than a third of what experienced and certified doulas charge. Regardless, I need these 3 births to get certified and begin growing my practice. 

Working with a doula client involves both gathering all information about their pregnancy, birth history, desires for their birth plan, and health information, as well as educating the client on certain decisions, comfort measures, procedures, and birth physiology. There are generally two prenatal meetings preceding the birth and one postpartum meeting afterwords. I’ve held two meetings for different clients. 

It’s overwhelming having little guidance while jumping into such a large career. No one tells you how to run a prenatal meeting. Your textbook knowledge has to be accurate and unbiased. You have to be intuitive to a laboring woman’s needs when she can’t express them verbally. You need to be an expert at active listening and mediation without any personal input or advice.   You need to have thick skin and be open to rejection and criticism from doctors, nurses, clients, other doulas, midwives, and close-minded people who believe there’s a “right” way to give birth. 

With the lack of support, training, and insight, I slaved over creating an itinerary with minuscule help from Google and a few of my birth books before I ran my first meeting. This is where it gets tough. I know the meeting went well, but I still went home and cried. No matter how much I prepare or how well I know I’ve done, I can’t make myself believe I actually belong here. After my second meeting, I was 100% convinced that the couple wanted nothing to do with me. That they’d opted out of wanting a doula after all and they would just ghost me. Of course, this was not the case but it seemed so real in my head. 

At one point, I made an Instagram post about the importance of skin to skin contact directly after birth to meet my “one social media post per month” quota for a local doula group I’m in. A midwife dm’d me, disagreeing with a claim I made about newborn discomfort in the birth canal. I’d read about this fact before and it was even brought up in my initial doula training. I was sure I was correct, yet I was sent into one of the worst spirals of self-hatred of my life. I’d never felt so incompetent. My thoughts had never been scarier. I was convinced that everyone I had status with had seen the post and disagreed with it and I was now the laughing stalk of the area. I then pinned this idea to the itinerary of an upcoming meeting with my doula group, and I was convinced one of the topics was added because of my post. I emailed the leader of the group (actually it turns out I emailed THE ENTIRE BOARD) with a panicked message about how sorry I was. She had no idea what I was talking about and I completely humiliated myself as a new, inexperienced member.

Just today, I received a text from a client saying she was checking into an appointment with her midwife that I had agreed to attend. I’d forgotten to put it on my calendar, and I was currently tied up with one of my 3 other jobs, which was nannying my infant nieces. I had to explain the situation and apologize profusely and I could tell she wasn’t impressed. I’ve been thrown between beating myself up and distracting myself all day.

Somehow, every time I move forward, I feel like absolute shit. Every time I make a mistake I feel like absolute shit. Every single thing I do makes me want to give it all up because I can never ever be good enough. People tell me I’m born for this field and it’s my calling. This is genuinely my dream career and I want to believe them. Everyone says that every doula is important because we all offer different skills and personality traits. I want to know I’m not just the one exception to that. I’m working my ass off and pouring so much time and money into getting my life started, but I just don’t feel like I’m good enough. I hate this feeling so much. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and confidently learn from my mistakes, but both just make me hate myself. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in therapy and I’ve done all the natural mental health support I can do and nothings changing. I’m terrified for when I actually support my first birth (I’ve attended two as a shadow to an experienced doula but never been the primary.) I’m worried the self-doubt is the only thing holding me back and it’s eventually going to tear me down.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I’ve done good.

4272,"In finite games (or games where there is a goal, a winner and a loser, and set boundaries), the prize is a title (whether that is being a gold medalist, getting a promotion, or being a degree holder). This is in contrast of infinite games, where there are no winners, and the point of the game is to keep the game going (for example, the game of literature, the game of science, and the game of music). 

Imposter Syndrome typically occurs to me, and maybe some of you, in school or at work (both in which are finite games). The titles that we earn in finite games are titles symbolizing the accomplishments of the past. Having a Harvard degree symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Becoming a director symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Getting a gold medal symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. These titles are not about the present, but the past! These titles are a form of credit that tells the world that we did well in the past; the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Possibly, anxiety from Imposter Syndrome comes from having the titles but being unsure about our capacity to hold up to the expectations of these titles.

How does one hold up to the expectations of these titles? One possibility is to do well enough... in which you later get another title. And then the cycle repeats itself. You can have your high school degree, your bachelors, your masters, and you can be part of the C-suite, and still have Imposter Syndrome. 

My proposed solution, and I know it's easier said than done, is to let go of the expectations and trust that we've been appropriately given the title. There is no way that *all* these people, institutions, and systems were wrong. Since part of the anxiety is not meeting expectations, another thing that can be done is focusing on the present and do the best we can - the chances are that we can meet expectations. After all, it's a game and we've been beating level after level - we're literally where we are supposed to be.",trust

To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I need opinions - is my Dad right or is there something funny happening with the internship offer?",anticipation

I was diagnosed with anxiety about 6 years ago, but was told I'd need to see a psychologist if I wanted to find the root of the cause. Going through college and internships, I never had the time or resources for that, never would have thought I'd hear something so eye opening to me on reddit. Decided to see if there was a subreddit for this and wow, I always thought these thoughts and feelings were weird, but 4.2M members? That's amazing!",anticipation
4280,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you’re succeeding, even if you “don’t have the skills,” it’s the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You’re succeeding. It’s the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that’s who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It’s hard to tell internally whether you’re funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You’re not a good judge of that. You’re on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people’s actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it’s so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn’t be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There’s no downside. Even if you don’t “need” it or supposedly don’t “deserve” it, it doesn’t matter, because it’s a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you’ll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don’t know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I’ll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I’ve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I’ve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there’s a more tangible motivator- ‘I really want to have a good day, and it’s statistically much more likely if I’m productive.’ Try it if you’d like. Idk. I didn’t keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain’t real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it’s happening, that’s a fantastic help. It’s even better when/if you’re able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I’m rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you’ll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful. ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

I've somehow managed to build this reputation of being a confident, self-assured, sociable guy but inside I feel like I'm really not. Those qualities listed above are what I believe to be the way that people perceive me (based on what they've said and that I've heard) but I don't consider myself any of those things. 

They all assume I'm extroverted and confident, the topic has come up before, but I get socially anxious about speaking up, I stutter a lot, my mind blanks while I speak, I dwell over interactions way after they're done. But somehow, on the outside that doesn't come across. So I start getting treated as a person that I really am not. At times it can make me very uncomfortable and I'm subjected to expectations that I am not able to meet. 

Now, the thing is, I like being perceived this way. It's nice that people think you're self-assured and confident but am I just being a faker? Am I supposed to be true to who I really am or continue a charade. I hope this makes sense, I hope I don't come across as conceited, I'm just feeling like an imposter.",trust

4299,"idk if this is the place for this.   like trying to get into a new thing, a new franchise.  actually, pretty much anything ive been a part of i often feel like im not a 'true fan'.   so for example, something old that i liked since i was a kid was pokemon.  i started out with the first games, RBY.    i dont really feel like an imposter for liking pokemon, but sometimes i still do.  but even moreso is something like street figther.  i never played traditional fighting games until a few years ago, with Street Fighter V.   i really want to like it, but i feel like such idk, an outsider? a fake? both.   i wasnt a part of the community that followed the games from the originals.   i like the storyline, the lore, but since i wasnt a part of it from the beginning, i feel detached from it somehow.  like its not a part of me and never will be.  whereas pokemon, its practically part of my identity (maybe thats a bad thing too, basing myself off of external things, trying to see myself in characters and not seeing the characters as separate entities from myself, but i have always struggled with knowing myself in general).     


but its just especially prevalent with new things. i cant get into things easily.  i constantly think about the people who know more, have been around longer, are better at the videogames, what have you.   makes me feel like trying to find ""my"" thing, but i dont have a thing.   ""jack of all trades, master of none, better than a master of one"", but that doesnt feel true. i wish i was really good at one thing.  i feel im straying from my original issue, but well, its that i cant commit to anything.  my passions are flimsy, i never feel completely immersed in anything--instrument, music, movies, drawing, videogames, skilltoys; i do all these different things but i never completely can give myself permission to just enjoy something fully.  i always feel sortof detached no matter what i do--and that also prevents me from really excelling at anything, i think.     


but it also feels like a depression thing.  it feels sorta cyclical; cant get immersed-->dont feel enjoyment-->cant get immersed.  which came first, idk, but the result is me being more or less numb.    and t his extends to so much beyond just liking things. its like part of who and how i am.   like afraid to be real.  so afraid that i forget how to stop being afraid, and when i start to mellow out, i get anxious becuse suddenly there's a weight to everything.  to social interactions. to the real world.  and then i go numb again, because its safer to have this hyper-aware, low level anxiety combined with a detachment from personal feelings, than to actually feel.   but feeling is what makes life worth living, obviously.   gotta take the good with the bad, or neither and end up with nothing.  but the bad psyches me out to the point of giving up on anything i started to be passionate about--thus cyclical.  its like my choices are: feel too much, or feel nothing.  yeah this is definitely beyond just imposter syndrome, but it also feels like it isnt. like its a part of imposter syndrome.

For context, I’m 26, from the UK. A few years ago I completed an undergraduate degree in Physics, then recently my PhD. For the last 10 months I’ve been working as a Data Analyst - I passed my probation with no problems and I’m doing well at it.

Despite all of this, I still convince myself every day that I know barely anything; that everyone else is so much better than me, and that I’m just no good. I’m also scared to apply for higher paying roles because I’m worried I’ve found my limit, and that if I got another role I’d fail my probation or something.

I also have concerns about my memory. I’ve learnt so much stuff over the years and now I just feel like I’m forgetting so much, and just that I’m so much more forgetful and distant than previously. I sometimes struggle to pay attention in simple conversations with family and friends because my mind is elsewhere trying to see if I can remember (almost testing myself) stuff to prove I’ve not forgotten something. Maybe it’s just part of getting older, I don’t know…

I know this is probably all just imposter syndrome because nobody has ever raised any concerns about my ability or conduct. And, that the reason I’m probably forgetting more things is because I’m still learning other new things.

Fast forward, after he had cheated on me again we ended up getting divorced, two kids deep. I started dating this guy I considered safe because safety emotionally was my main concern after being cheated on terribly. This man wasn’t safe. I remember him saying, “I’m surprised your waist is that skinny.” “Your ankles are kind of fat.” It was like a load of bricks hit me. Why say that? Why point that out? He was no supermodel and of course I wasn’t scrutinizing his appearance. I just wanted a loving relationship. Fast fast forward. The scrutiny turned into much more. Making fun of me in front of his friends for laughs, hitting in my friends, being angry at me for not indulging him in a threesome, saying it was unfair and that I was effecting his life in an unfair way by withholding.

When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don’t know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I’m so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my “thing”, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can’t you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your “thing”?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before.

Why did I write all this? Because everytime I tell people one of those things they say ""that must've been a hard childhood"". The thing is I kinda don't believe that because 1. I have great parents and friends who love and support me and 2. This is just my reality. To come back to my title I get fatigued very easily to the point where I need two days off from school almost every second week and it makes me feel like an idiot especially when my grades are fairly good. I can't explain this fatigue with my two bodily illnesses (?!?) Which makes me think I can't handle school. 

Tldr: I have various illnesses but can't explain my fatigue with them leading me to believe I am to weak for normal life

I have ADD and I have to work a little harder than everyone else. That's one of the reasons I struggled later in my high school career. I was undiagnosed and I really couldn't study. I can kinda boast I did far better in college after I started managing my ADD with supplements and exercise.

I feel like I don’t belong, I think I’m procrastinating and wasting my time all of the time, even though I have been doing work and being as focused and motivated as I can. My mind zones out and I have memory blocks of what I’ve done the past few weeks to  compensates for the deep discomfort that any moment now I’m going to be called out for not meeting expectations. It’s all happy toxic positive at work, so even though people are encouraged to be honest about how they feel, there’s a underlying consequence that comes with opening up.

4320,"Hi All,

Let me start by saying I believe I've had imposter syndrome for as long as I can remember (going back to elementary school and believing I was not at the same level as my school peers).

&#x200B;

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job. I've been working on my resume (obsessing mostly), trying to perfect it, sell myself as best I can without over-selling. My father says I need to just start applying but I am just so anxious that any job I get with some responsibility, I'll end up failing.

&#x200B;

I do suffer from anxiety and OCD, so I'm basically always already doubting myself. The thing is, through experience, I tend to overthink situations. I have for as long as I can remember. But in the end, things that I've overthought tend to not be as scary as I've made them in my mind.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

4322,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",trust
4324,"My imposter syndrome has been particularly heavy with this new job I have. I feel like I don’t totally know what’s going on or what to do, and I find myself without something to do most of the day. I’ve tried talking to my supervisor about more clarification on what to do but all she’s really told me is that due to COVID, I can’t be sent to any trainings for the specific job so I need to just take initiative for any projects I think need to be head up. This directive made me incredibly stressed especially since I haven’t seen anything or identified any projects since she’s told me that. I feel like it’s because I’m being lazy or not smart enough to identify those situations.

She just sent me an email to schedule a feedback session (a normal occurrence around this time of the year) and I am absolutely riddled with stress because I feel like I am going to be called out for incompetence and laziness. Specifically for my lack of initiative.

4331,"I guess I just need to get this out and see if this mirrors anyone else's experience.

Or if I'm just completely out of my mind.

My therapist definitely believes I have impostor syndrome. This is based on some information I explained to him. In my classes (senior in college), for example, I received an A on both term papers for both courses last term, a 97% and a 98%. And I am still waiting for the grade to be lowered because SURELY these professionals have to figure out that it's all fraudulent. The school I go to uses turn it in and I am able to see my results, both had low %s meaning the content was original, yet I'm still convinced somehow I must've cheated on the assignments. Logically, I know I did not, I remember the painstaking and grueling hours reading the research, putting them together and writing it out in the APA format. I also did well on the quizzes. I can't fathom that I have gotten those grades on my own but I know, logically, I did.

I am also a community activist locally. I don't do anything major or impressive--but it requires me to confront politicians and community leaders with a ton of stats and facts. I am known for my skills in researching and strategy on these topics. I am by no means a mastermind. But I am often able to cite case studies and statistics --yet, even though I've done the hours of research, written them down into an essay, presented them and even have had them double checked, I constantly have to re-check the information before speaking on them again, as I am convinced I have them wrong or made them up. 

This all sounds like impostor syndrome to me--but the part that I never hear about it and I wonder if anyone else deals with this or if its a totally different ""syndrome"". I don't just expect to exposed as a fraud, I expect to be exposed as a horrible human being. I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, most of which I've at least made an effort to atone for, but I am constantly waiting for my ""horrid actions"" to bd exposed--and often times, they are imagined actions or they are based on real events but ""modified"".

One example and I know this sounds strange: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up 3 years ago (almost). And it was a nasty fight, I was crude and petty. The relationship NEEDED to end. I regret how I ended it. But we made amends for both of our wrongdoings throughout the relationship and while we've maintained a healthy emotional distance since then, when we see each other (pre-COVID) we say hi, we've had some small social media interactions and we've even discussed the end of our relationship. In fact, we respect each other very much and the relationship. Yet, nonsensically, I've ""imagined"" him ""exposing"" me as this horrid person who destroyed his life. I know that's not going to happen and it's not true--but it has become to the point that I actually thought I was going to lose all my friends and my standing in my community over it. But there's no actual basis for this. 

I also am frequently expecting the law to come to me and ""catch me"" for the horrible crimes I've committed. I fear being caught, but not for anything I've done, but rather, that I'll be ""planted"" and charged. Now, I am a community activist but not high level enough to worry about that happening.

All of this is based on non-sense. And I have not been diagnosed with anything like psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't have auditory or visual hallucinations. But I am constantly surrounded by guilt and feelings of inadequacy, which I believe is beyond the average persons standard of self-doubt and insecurity.

Thank you for letting me share and I know I sound ""crazy"". If you have any advice or resources, or similar stories (even if you would prefer to share them in a private message), I'm here to listen.

I work for the state and have a good, stable job with benefits. But I feel like I don't belong.
I've talked about this to my wife and with my boss (a little). They both tell me to, essentially, lighten up and that I'm qualified. Technically, I am qualified, but I feel like such an outsider. I don't belong here.

4337,"**EDIT:  I cross-posted this to** r/askpsychology **, and am much calmer than I was when I first posted.  I have settled into a tired, calm numbness, but I don't think that it is a bad thing, given the circumstances.** 

&#x200B;

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female.  I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work.  Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon.  My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack.  For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

&#x200B;

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud.  As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear.  I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome.  I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too.  Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it.  I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

&#x200B;

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten.  I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after.  I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter.  I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME.  I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me.  ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ <--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it.  I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

&#x200B;

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself.  But I am definitely in crisis.  The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline.  The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it.  I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me.  I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me.  That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

&#x200B;

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work.  I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth.  I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents).  I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is.  He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere.  I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me.  So I try to make him as happy as possible.  He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

&#x200B;

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life.  And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have.  In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can.  I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON.  Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine.  But I lie.  My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason.  I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day.  I ignore them.  One of these bills is for $8.  Eight fucking dollars.  I'm paralyzed about it.  I won't fix it.  These are only a few aspects of my life as examples.  I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships.  I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having.  I lie about having other plans.  I deserve to have my life fucked up.  I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway.  At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it...  It feels like my whole world is upside down.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, thank you.  I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this.  The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

&#x200B;

This is the first day of my life.  Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where.  I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing.  I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

4339,"Alrighty, little background about me. M20, currently going to uni for Health Studies and I’m in my third year. This year, most of my classes have in personal components, but the last two were all virtually online. Now my issue here is that, I hardly ever try for my classes and I pump out 90 after 90 and keep getting told that I’m doing so well and get told that they can see that I put effort into my writing. When in actuality, I put a total of 5 hours of effort, the day before it’s due. Getting this kind of feedback day in and out and then seeing people who ACTUALLY put in the effort getting 60’s and 50’s is crushing my mind with guilt and anxiety. I don’t even tel anyone my average because I don’t feel like I deserve it, even saying that I get 90’s while doing literally doing all the work last minute makes me sick to my stomach. 

For example, on a essay I had to write about a social topic of concern, I choose food scarcity. So did 5 other people. Now, I obviously left it to the last minute, threw some things together and BAM, essay done. Everyone else, took the entire 2 months allotted to this assignment that’s worth 40% of our overall grade to do it. Grades come back and I was fully expecting a 60% and I would’ve been okay with that. Turns out I got a 97% and everyone else, got a 68% or lower. And when everyone asked me how long did I work on it, I felt so guilty telling them that I worked on it for 8 hours before the deadline and got a 30% higher grade when they spent over a month researching and writing and editing. I’m by no means the smartest person in the room, and I definitely don’t feel like I deserve the grades that I’m somehow pulling out of thin air, but I can’t help but feel guilty over this. I even doubt if I have imposter syndrome? Or if i am just smart?  Idek

I grew up poor in a small town with 3 bipolar siblings and a bipolar father. None of my siblings graduated from high school. All 3 went to rehab in some capacity. Only one isn’t supported by someone else right now. Suffice to say it was rough growing up and I was lumped in with them as never being expected to amount to much.

Fast forward- I graduated top of my class in high school. Via scholarship, a full time job, and student loans I went to a local state school and received my degree cum laude. Landed a great job and a year ago purchased a house with my wife and two dogs.

Today, I went with a colleague to a local country club his family has been a part of for generations. He’s sponsoring me to become a member. 

And I realized that no matter how much money I make or how well I do in life, I will not be looked at as part of “them” at this club. Everyone there went to prestigious schools, drives expensive cars, and is clean cut with no tattoos. I’ve spent so many years reaching for this goal to feel like I really “succeeded” and I now realize it will never be enough.

4343,"So last week I was losing my mind.  I've been negotiating with this potential vendor, and we had a meeting and afterward I didn't hear from them for a few days.  So I'm like, 'look how much of a fuckup I am, that I can't even entice vendors', I was convinced that I'd sounded like an asshat, not knowing what I was talking about.  At the same time, I got pissy with a customer because they were asking about a bunch of asinine stuff, so then I spent two days convinced I was going to get fired for pissing off a customer.  And add to it, my mentor asked how I was doing, and I wrote back this 'fear of failure' thing, and then didn't hear back from him...

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.  And my mentor made this long apology about how he should be doing better by me if I feel like a failure, that he loves working with me, etc.

It's all just so tough to believe sometimes...  I'm totally convinced I should be a janitor, that I'm not worth a damn to this company I've been a manager at for nearly twenty years.

4344,"So this was a cultural event and the prep, auditions, everything started sometime in late December. Ofc, i battled my anxiety and attended the first meet somehow, and few auditions but never could muster up the courage to just go for it.

I failed a class last semester and for some reason it hasn't hit me. I know I'm supposed to feel bad about it but when I see the failing number, I don't know what I feel. I hate talking about grades, some days they matter and other days they don't.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university. The stuff with new guidelines but no updates and whenever I get an update email I tell myself I'll read it later but never do it. Even though it's easier than ever to get in touch in a person with just a click of a button it feels even harder because I don't know who I'm getting in touch with.

I know that I've got bad study habits but breaking them feels impossible. I have good intentions of bettering myself but the rest of my body doesn't listen to my mind. When I tell myself I'll set a routine, I set it, then I don't follow it. I'm just really lost right now.

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly. Sometimes if I have a backup or another I feel more comfortable using it. What made me realize it is my laptop, the surface pro 3 I got 5 years ago I've always felt weird using it, but now that I was just given the pro 7 for Christmas I feel way more comfortable using the old one because I know if it breaks I'll have another chance. (poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

Also last night going to bed I had the thought, ""I can't believe I'm not homeless"". A huge part of my imposter syndrome rn is being mostly financially dependent on my mom and not having financial independence yet. (28F) So I practice gratitude at night in bed, being thankful I have a place to sleep and thankful for my body. My bed is the only place I feel emotionally safe.

I was pretty indifferent towards them. But after a conversation that I had with Dylan about them, I love them. Feel almost that I have no right liking them. And that I'm doing the same thing that I used to do as a child.

4382,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me “there were people who did not want to employ you” and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either “I think you are an idiot” or “you are now fired”. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of “I am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...”. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn’t 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It’s silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don’t remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager’s manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I’ve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it’s ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",trust

4385,"New here. I work in film and theatre, or at least I'm trying to get into that industry as an actor/screenwriter/director. I like to do more than one thing. It's the sort of career where you learn on the job by speaking to other people and working with them. In short, you need to network like a fox. But I can't ask for help. If I did, I would be too terrified to be ridiculed and torn down because it's so obvious that I don't know what I'm doing and I would be exposed as a fraud, a pathetic laughing stock and a failure. But I need to ask for help to learn the skills to do my job. It's a vicious cycle. I grew up in the care system surrounded by narcissistic people and jaded social workers who just wanted to end the conversation and go home for their dinner instead of giving a shit about you or their job. Their favourite word was ""no"". Aiming to achieve anything other than working in a minimum wage job and living in a crap one bedroom flat was discouraged. So I had to go into every single meeting with them every 6-8 weeks feeling armed to the teeth for battle and it was exhausting. If I wanted or needed something I would have to plan an entire TEDx talk to get through it and if they found one single area in my idea that wasn't quite developed yet, they would be like ""AHA!"", and jump right in there to tear me down and keep me under their boot. I was constantly reminded of how I was a stupid little girl living in a fantasy world and had no idea what I was doing or what reality was. They would straight up make fun of you. But they never taught me anything to help me with normal life either because they want you to stay helpless and rely on the system, and then judged me for not having a clue how to do simple things despite it being their responsibility to teach you. You weren't allowed to do anything for yourself (and there were often consequences when you tried to) and then at a certain age, they expected you to just magically be able to do it. So now if I want to do anything at all, even the simplest of things like asking someone how I write a script, I can't. I'm too afraid that the rest of the world is exactly like them. I don't want them to laugh at me if I want to make films and have no idea where to start. If I try to overwhelm myself by doing everything, I fail.

Everybody around me seems to have their shit in place so looking to my peers for advice seems counterproductive. Any advice would be much appreciated!,anger
4401,"Tonight I threw my hat in the ring for a job I'm really interested in, that I and others thought I would be qualified for, and I overcame my self doubt and imposter syndrome to pull together my application and submit it tonight. I may not get an interview but I'm glad j at least tried!",anticipation
4402,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn’t put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn’t. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family’s and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if’s. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it’s why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I’ve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what’s looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don’t look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it’s offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don’t have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We’ll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don’t feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don’t treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven’t earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn’t earn it, that’s bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that’s where you go so ride it out. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don’t go down the dark hole there’s nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.


If you suffer badly from this i suggest reading the book, “ The Alchemist”

God luck guys!

I have been to the depths of imposter hell and crawled my way back up over years and now wear those scars like a badge of Fucking honor. If anybody of you need somebody to chat with or help feel Free to reach out I’d love to keep rock bottom at a very low vacancy as it’s not somewhere you want to go.

4404,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day. I'd been wanting to apply elsewhere for a while now and now is probably a good time, but I suddenly feel so humiliated and discouraged that I don't feel like I'd be good enough anywhere.",trust
4406,"The title summarises most of this but basically, I get a lot of compliments from people. Like a lot a lot. I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre. Not to say there's anything wrong with being average, I don't mind it,  but,  well,  yeah, I'm average. Yet everyone insists I'm not. It's gotten to the point where I assume that it's because of my disability.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends. I just feel ashamed when people with so many accolades Call ME smart or talented.

I worry that I'm somehow deceiving my friends,  I've tricked them into thinking I'm not a lazy inept POS.

4410,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.  It feels like it's all catching up to me and it really, really sucks.",trust

I will be contributing no additional effort into a class I'm already excelling in.

Around 95% of the time I felt frustrated, depressed and anxious before every day of work that it ruins me and I can’t get ANYTHING before work. I work at night around the 4/5pm - 11:30pm/12:30am range. Everyday I wake up I feel not ready for the shift at all. Then the shift happens and I’m scared during the whole shift. The job is relatively easy but I still feel like a fraud. I talked to my therapist about this and that’s when I learned about imposter syndrome. I believe I have it but I also think genuinely I’m not ready or posses the capability and motivation to continue this position. However EVERYONE tells me I’m doing a good job and that I’m too hard on myself. 

They’ve talked to me multiple times saying I need to stop being hard on myself but when I fail and see them get upset it just shuts me down completely and makes me wants to scream “I told you I’m not cut out for this” I’m also writing this right before my shift.

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",trust
4429,"I hear a lot about Imposter Syndrome in the terms of careers and the workplace but less socially which is something I'm facing. 

I've somehow managed to build this reputation of being a confident, self-assured, sociable guy but inside I feel like I'm really not. Those qualities listed above are what I believe to be the way that people perceive me (based on what they've said and that I've heard) but I don't consider myself any of those things. 

They all assume I'm extroverted and confident, the topic has come up before, but I get socially anxious about speaking up, I stutter a lot, my mind blanks while I speak, I dwell over interactions way after they're done. But somehow, on the outside that doesn't come across. So I start getting treated as a person that I really am not. At times it can make me very uncomfortable and I'm subjected to expectations that I am not able to meet.

4430,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling with intrusive and negative thought about myself for more than 4 years now and I just can’t deal with it no more. I want to reduce my symptoms but I have yet failed to do so. There is a naut in my reasoning and I need to undo but I need help.

So I consider myself pretty lucky. I have good parents, I have always done good at school during childhood. I guess I always had an underlying anxiety issue because at age 15, I could bare a break up and tried (unsuccessfully-thanks lord) to end my life. This depressive period change something in me because I started to put way more importance and attention to my grades. In college, I was often 20% above average in my class, gpa (R score) way above the mean. Yet, I always aimed to get higher, never satisfied. Always giving more than requested in evaluations, making myself almost on the verge of burn out but the adrenaline kept pushing me. In my music recital, I would cry or get mad after my performance because I made mistakes I didn’t do when rehearsing, my music teacher feeling bad for me. When I did good, I always felt awkward, putting it on chance, trying to hide/deviate the conversation.

Then last year, I got in the undergraduate program I wanted (cognitive neuroscience) and everything got worst. I’m (now doubting) aiming to enter a PhD program, so does the majority of my 500 classmates, but only 12 places are available. The teachers had to put fire under our ass : “grades are not enough”, “you need to have above 4/4.3 of gpa, get hundreds of hours in research and clinical experience, win scholarships, publish”. I got scared, but for real, but I already knew this : before even starting my program I had already contacted researcher to join their lab. Week 2 of my bachelor : I had researcher assistant position. But I felt like a total incompetent and intrude. I never been in a lab in my entire life, didn’t pass a single exam and I got it almost first shot. So that was both scary and unpleasant. When I went to ask a question on a programming class to my neuroanatomy teacher for my job, he told the entire class (250 persons) that “one of your colleagues already had a research job so everyone of you should hurry up because place at PhD are limited”. The entire class released a surprise “ahh.. omg” I was humiliated (my ears turned red), wanted to burry myself 6 feet under. But now I felt the pressure, because my classmate started to recognize me.

1 year later, I got coauthorship for an article published in A famous Journal. I don’t feel I own it : I feel like an intrude. I didn’t wrote a single line of it, I was just there to help with the analysis, put comments and correct it. I feel like it was a huge gift from the postdoc and director that mentor me. The article got accepted in first round because he did an incredible work. Not only it is rare to publish as an undergraduate : it is rare to publish it that journal and it is rare that it get accepted first round. I feel uncomfortable. I feel now the bar is set so, so high. Failure is at my door and I’m scare to disappoint them. My director wants me to prepare a presentation on my “perspective on my first redaction experience, and give tips to trainee” (when I’m the youngest trainee in the entire team). I legitimately don’t know what to say: I feel and felt like an intruder for the entire process.

My classmates and colleague relly heavily on me and seem to except that I know everything, but I don’t. My director gave me a graduate level project to take over and I’ve been freezing for 3 month because I don’t know how to manage it. I don’t even know what I want to do of my life anymore but I feel I have to act like I do, at least for being a model to my classmate that don’t stop asking me question to get to my position. but I have almost no one my age to rely on in return. Mentor already projecting me publicly growing in academia but I feel stupid and so not creative compare to them. I didn’t do my math (calculus, linear algebra) and now I feel like an handicapped student.

4433,"Which is why I don’t even want to fight it anymore. I feel like I am a lie, somehow someone just not deserving or allowed to live a normal life. I just want to live my life free of feeling like I’m lying to myself and others. But it’s got so bad I don’t want to try anything new anymore. I just want to coil away and restart everything.
It might sound like an overreaction but it’s truly eating away my motivation and ability to focus. Behind every action I make, I have a voice tell me to “quit fooling yourself”, or “that’s not what the real you would do” and it slows me down.

A little context to my story, I’m recently pulling out of a deep depression from earlier this year that I’m proud of getting out of. But recently, somewhere in my mind the idea that I’m “supposed” to be depressed is beginning to arise. The idea of loneliness as well. It only magnifies my failures and shortcomings for me. 

It’s hard to control it, to fight it, but it’s like it’s relentless. I’ve tried becoming hyper aware of my thought processes and being mindful but that’s only made me more aware of my shortcomings.

These thoughts rule my mind, the ideas of doing something with my life get blanketed by reminders that I’ve fucked up. That I’ve failed a million times and am terrible at being confident. 

I honestly don’t know who I am because of how many times I’ve reinvented my personality from the ground up to fight depression and escape.

So when people say to me, “Be yourself” it means nothing. I don’t know what’s real anymore.",trust
4434,"Maybe it’s just been a rough week but I just feel like I’m not cut out to be a tax accountant.

Long story short - I graduated college at the end of 2019 and started my first accounting job out of college at a really small firm, with no previous experience. I prepared mostly personal taxes, a few 1120s and 1065s, and was also involved in bookkeeping. There was minimal training and I really learned what I could from asking questions and just doing the work. I was with them for over 2 1/2 years but decided to leave due to off season stress of not having enough work (if I had no work they wouldn’t let me study for my CPA either) and the fact I didn’t see myself being promoted anytime soon (I was the only staff for a good 6 months towards the end).

I decided to go to a mid level firm and accepted a staff roll. I’ve loved it so far and love all the opportunities I’m being given to work on bigger clients and focus on my weaker areas. However, I feel like coming in with 2 1/2 years I didn’t expect to have such a learning curve (I definitely knew I would come in with less experience in certain areas) Coming from a state with no income tax, working on mostly individuals, and having no actual formal training other than just on the job has put me at a disadvantage. I feel so dumb compared to other staff. I’ve been put on large clients with multi-state returns, and many things I haven’t seen before (Which I’ve disclosed). I’ve tried my best to learn; but everything takes me longer, I’m still perfecting and trying to make my work papers clean, and I feel like I‘m not doing good enough :( During engagement meetings I try and take very detailed notes - but I feel like I always miss something. Or my work papers aren’t done quite the right way for the reviewer - or I just misunderstand what should be done. I want to ask more questions, but I either feel too stupid or don’t know what to ask (Like I think I do understand something - when in reality I don’t) Most of the smaller returns I've worked  on I’ve gotten good feedback on. I haven’t gotten any bad feedback so far - I can just know that it takes a lot more patience to work with me on bigger projects/ returns right now and certain reviewers probably get frustrated with me. I’ve started to get anxiety while I’m working again and I don’t feel like I’m meeting expectations. I don’t feel like I can turn down work since I still am trying to prove myself and work with a variety of people - I’ve taken maybe 2 actual days of PTO since busy season ended and I’m just feeling stressed. I’m just trying to keep pushing through knowing that maybe there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s so frustrating after being in accounting as a staff for almost 3 1/2 years to feel this way, is accounting even what I want to pursue? Will I ever get better? I really want to be a CPA but I just feel like I’m too stupid. I feel like all my friends are getting promoted and doing amazing and their jobs just love them. I’m 25 and I just don’t feel like I’m ever going to be successful :( 

It’s been a rough year for me with personal tragedy occurring in the middle of busy season as well. I’m in therapy to work on managing my busy schedule (both personally and at work) as well as work through some childhood trauma. I definitely feel like my personal issues during busy season did affect my work and motivation - but I’m trying to get back into it and I just don’t feel like I’m doing enough.",trust

My dad has offered me to get paid for cooking a while back. I declined, although my sister, who doesn't live at home, was very supportive of the idea. I told them I just liked cooking.

When I was asked what I wanted for my birthday, I didn't know what to say. It's not like there is nothing I want. There are a lot of things, but all of them seemed too expensive or hard to get. I honestly had no idea. I told my parents to not spend too much.

Although I've tried to tell myself that I've done enough already, I couldn't feel more like a fraud. There are so many points that I could consider when telling myself I am who everyone thinks I am, but my mind comes up with very convincing counterpoints.

Considering a 31 is the BEST ACT score IN THE JUNIOR CLASS, it makes me feel like I'm going to a school of very low academic achievement. This leads into my next point. I was just elected the president of my school's National Honors Society, but I don't feel I deserve it. The members are all extremely lazy, but I hope that changes in Senior year.

When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don’t know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I’m so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my “thing”, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can’t you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your “thing”?

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.  It feels like it's all catching up to me and it really, really sucks.",trust

Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

Long-time sufferer of imposter syndrome here. In the past two years my salary has grown greatly from job changes (what a silly thing to stress over) and it’s freaking me out. I was at 35,000, then I jumped to 70,000 at a new job, and now I have an offer for 100,000.

One of my professors in school would have me do reframing techniques and keeping a diary. It was a way for me to stop doubting myself so much, realize what I've accomplished and the value I've created.  The process reframed how I looked at some situations and how I looked at myself. 

I recently did this in a roundabout way. I hired someone to do a bio, career history for me for a professional reason. I couldn't see all that I had accomplished myself and was struggling to see myself beyond the tasks I had carried out. As I was working with this person and the questions they asked I realized I needed to reframe again because I had lost sight of my value and validity.

Reframing is a technique that can help us refocus our feelings of inadequacy and create a balanced mental model of how we perceive ourselves or situations. Below is a link to an online interactive app that allows you to reframe.  

Use this to realize failure is a learning opportunity and reaffirm your success, validity, accomplishments, contributions and value. Also if you have other ideas you want a different perspective on this tool can help. I don't know who created it I was just looking for a reframing worksheet and found this instead.

*edit: the ‘highest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it’s one of the reasons why I don’t belong there

—-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I’ve been more insecure than ever lately & I’m having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‘ranked’ #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don’t always say everything - but let’s just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it’s because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‘honors/cum laude’ grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I’m not trying to say I’m absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I’m not actually super talented, I’m just good at ‘taking exams’ + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I’m neurodivergent and am quite ‘slow’ in understanding things (even if it’s something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren’t so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‘grade’ I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I’m a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

You’re succeeding. It’s the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that’s who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It’s hard to tell internally whether you’re funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You’re not a good judge of that. You’re on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people’s actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it’s so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn’t be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There’s no downside. Even if you don’t “need” it or supposedly don’t “deserve” it, it doesn’t matter, because it’s a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you’ll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don’t know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I’ll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I’ve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I’ve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there’s a more tangible motivator- ‘I really want to have a good day, and it’s statistically much more likely if I’m productive.’ Try it if you’d like. Idk. I didn’t keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain’t real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it’s happening, that’s a fantastic help. It’s even better when/if you’re able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I’m rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you’ll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful. ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ 

Imposter syndrome: “Red is sus”

Us: “No, actually, we’re not.”

4532,"Hi I’m 15yo, and I used to have impostor syndrome with my family and with my friend when I was younger. 

It’s horrible, intrusive thoughts randomly appear in your head saying that someone is using your mom body to spy on you, or Simeone else is inside your mom body, for example, that my friend is someone else, or that he’s other guy.
Of course I knew that it’s not true, but these things can make you anxious, and nervous 
That’s it I’m new here ! 🙃",fear
