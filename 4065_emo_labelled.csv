2271,"just finished my freshman year as an international student at one of the top US colleges for my major. i got a research opportunity my second semester here in the field that i hope to go into in the future (tbf the lab likes to accept young students bc theyre more likely to stay longer vs graduating halfway through their project). i managed to maintain a good gpa and made a good connection that led to another opportunity within sci comm and possibly a TA- adjacent position with this professor 

but i still feel like an imposter. i still feel like at any day i‚Äôll lose all of this. i think research has been one of the biggest sources of my imposter syndrome as a college student. before anyone says that i‚Äôm in a toxic lab or have a bad grad student that‚Äôs definitely not the case. my research is in a topic that i never had an official education about or even covered the basic background science (talking bare minimum stuff) due to my educational background. this led my o me lacking a lot of the basic knowledge, on top of the obvious of not knowing the detailed stuff. i spend so much time trying to understand this stuff but it feels like it never sticks. I don't know if im using this as an excuse or if it's real but I have really bad brain fog and it's gotten worse as my academically challenging institution was academically challenging lol. I always felt like I was behind in comparison to the other undergrads, they always sounded smart and knew what they were talking about and were taking advanced classes even though we're the same year. this kinda led me to spending a lot of time in lab to ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù. towards the end of the semester i initiated a conversation w my grad student telling her I feel like I haven't made enough progress in my project and she said she's more concerned about my understanding of conceptual stuff. I think this is still a persisting issue and she kind of implied it the last time we talked. sure she said ‚Äúyou're smart ik yk this‚Äù, at the end of the conversation she gave me feedback and I'm fine with that feedback and it's totally valid but it just reminded me of the first one. this ‚Äúimposter syndrome episode‚Äù also came in a bad time. 

my mom is sick with a big time zone difference and many many hours to get to her‚Äô and even then it‚Äôs not an option because life. my confidence is shook because i‚Äôve been making insanely many mistakes in lab, which didn‚Äôt happen my first semester. im not sleeping and struggling to eat, im pmsing and all of this is piling up to make me feel so weak. 

I know I'm fucking amazing and I achieved so much considering my background, but sometimes I feel like I'm not fit for this, lately I've been thinking a lot about whether I'm just not cut out for it and it's better to stop or and explore something else. I love my work so much and I'm not done with this I haven't learned everything I can learn but I just feel like I'm stuck in a loop of not feeling enough, busting my ass of studying outside lab and spending 15+ hours a week, and getting feedback that I'm not _there_ yet.

2274,"Hi everyone!

I've  been on a journey to improve my mental well-being and develop healthier thought patterns. Over the past year, I've faced challenges with  anxiety and found it difficult to break out of negative thought cycles. A. I  tried mindfulness exercises, but however hard I tried, I couldn't shut  off my thoughts. That's why I started looking for a different approach. That's when I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I started  challenging my unrealistic thoughts and learned how to react to them in a  more reasonable way.

However, doing this on your own, instead of with a therapist, is difficult. Even if you have a therapist, you only get help once a week instead of every time you are struggling with negative thoughts. So, I took matters  into my own hands and developed an app to make the process more  accessible and user-friendly. Here's how the app works:

1. Write a note whenever you find yourself overwhelmed by unhelpful thoughts.
2. The app analyzes your note, identifying common cognitive distortions.
3. Receive personalized suggestions to challenge and reframe your thoughts.

I've already got a couple hundred users and great feedback but I feel like imposter syndrome is basically the definition of distorted thinking, so I thought this might help a lot of you fighting imposter syndrome, and help me tailor the apps to your needs. The app is available as a beta on iOS and Android. 

If you're interested in trying it out and sharing your thoughts, please leave a comment or send me a direct message or join the Discord community where you can find all links you need: [https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3](https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3)

I am looking forward to hearing your input! üòä

2276,"I'm a 16 year old high school student in Arizona, about to enter my senior year, and I feel so far behind my peers. I feel I'm way too hard on myself, as I currently work a job and I'm ranked #5 in weighted GPA at my high school with a 4.209. That should be enough, right? Although I've tried to tell myself that I've done enough already, I couldn't feel more like a fraud. There are so many points that I could consider when telling myself I am who everyone thinks I am, but my mind comes up with very convincing counterpoints. For example, I achieved the highest ACT score of my class, where it was mandatory for all juniors to take the ACT, yet it was just a 31. Considering a 31 is the BEST ACT score IN THE JUNIOR CLASS, it makes me feel like I'm going to a school of very low academic achievement. This leads into my next point. I was just elected the president of my school's National Honors Society, but I don't feel I deserve it. The members are all extremely lazy, but I hope that changes in Senior year. I have quite a few ideas for improvements we can make to the club next year, but the running was a complete joke. In fact, I was the only student to even run for president, and I've only ever been to one event we held as a club (We''ve only ever had around 4. It was a super bad year for us.) and I hadn't even been to all of the meetings. On top of this, my SAT score is a little disappointing to me. I got a 1410. And I really don't mean for this to sound like a troll post, this is just what my brain keeps telling me. And I understand that in writing this sounds ridiculous, but it's just so rough. I wish I had done more extracurriculars while I could. I haven't done a single sport or other club save NHS and a few days of robotics club at the end of Junior year. This problem really has me considering my future, and fearing I'm going to be a failure. I feel like my GPA means nothing, especially being from one of the lowest ranked states as far as academics go. This is really just a vent post, as I understand it may sound ridiculous, but I just feel like I don't deserve any of the stuff I have, like I've just been really lucky to get good test scores but in reality I'm super unintelligent.

2277,"I am currently 30 years old and I have come to the realization that I severe imposter syndrome and that is the reason I have been so stuck in my life.

Background: I grew up in a Salvadoran household in NYC/Dallas, TX. My household was extremely violent because of my father. There are many stories of the extreme violence I encountered in my own house but that would take up too much writing. I already started to feel insecure in how people viewed me and my family because of this so I already started to develop a feeling of being ‚Äúless than‚Äù, at a very young age. 

My father was over protective and violent with my siblings and I, so that sometimes translated in social interactions. I can‚Äôt tell you the amount of embarrassing moments I had in my life because I was literally ignorant and it was something I should have been taught. I always lacked discipline and consistency throughout my whole life. Those moments really fucked up my self esteem even more. 

I have always felt insecure about my literacy level both in English and Spanish, which, I feel, is common among children of immigrant parents. I never felt that I was smart enough to use more advanced vocabulary in my everyday conversations and, if I did, I would feel like fraud or poser for using it. I carried that with me my whole life. 

At the age of 13, I started to realize that I was different. I grew up in a Christian church and the LGBTQIA+ was always being talked about. Growing in a Latino household, there was a bunch of homophobic comments, jokes, etc. And i attended a Christian university. üò≠ So all of those experiences made it very difficult to accept that I was gay which added to my insecurities. 

All these experiences really started to affect me on another level while I was in college, which I think is when most people start experiencing imposter syndrome. I was studying music, vocal performance. Which is a horrible degree for someone who gets anxiety from people judging you. Throughout my whole college career, I didn‚Äôt feel good enough about anything I did. Literally. I didn‚Äôt feel talented enough. Smart enough. Good enough. 
I knew I was gay but felt like I needed to control my every move and hide it as much as I could and wanted it to go away. 

After graduating the only thing I got better at had to do with sexuality. I came out to people and all but the other stuff stayed with me. It was so hard for me to find a stable job because my interviews were so terrible because I had severe anxiety for my interview. Sweating like crazy and all. Over thought my answers. I didn‚Äôt feel at the same level of the persons interviewing me. I never felt good enough for a white collar job sometimes I still don‚Äôt because of my past. I didn‚Äôt pursue anything in music because I always felt like I wasn‚Äôt good enough and felt like a fraud for calling myself a musician. 

Eventually, I got a job with my brother doing concrete polishing. Which made me comfortable because I didn‚Äôt have to work through those traumas that really play into my imposter syndrome. Fast forward to 2021. I got a job that was unionized so I was excited because of all the perks but even there my IS showed up. I didn‚Äôt want to lose my job so my anxiety was through the roof. Overthought everything. Always felt like I was going to lose my job. Felt like I needed to be perfect in everything.

I started doing side work with my brother again and it was time for me to start teaching the new workers the skill because I have done it for 7 years. That made them view me as someone who can advise them on the job and I felt so weird to be seen in that position and wrong lol. 

These past few months I have been having a breakthrough. I feel today I can walk in a room and be the most confident I could ever be even if I don‚Äôt get the result I want because honestly it will be alright. 

Sorry for the long post and if it doesn‚Äôt make sense.

2278,"Maybe it‚Äôs just been a rough week but I just feel like I‚Äôm not cut out to be a tax accountant.

Long story short - I graduated college at the end of 2019 and started my first accounting job out of college at a really small firm, with no previous experience. I prepared mostly personal taxes, a few 1120s and 1065s, and was also involved in bookkeeping. There was minimal training and I really learned what I could from asking questions and just doing the work. I was with them for over 2 1/2 years but decided to leave due to off season stress of not having enough work (if I had no work they wouldn‚Äôt let me study for my CPA either) and the fact I didn‚Äôt see myself being promoted anytime soon (I was the only staff for a good 6 months towards the end).

I decided to go to a mid level firm and accepted a staff roll. I‚Äôve loved it so far and love all the opportunities I‚Äôm being given to work on bigger clients and focus on my weaker areas. However, I feel like coming in with 2 1/2 years I didn‚Äôt expect to have such a learning curve (I definitely knew I would come in with less experience in certain areas) Coming from a state with no income tax, working on mostly individuals, and having no actual formal training other than just on the job has put me at a disadvantage. I feel so dumb compared to other staff. I‚Äôve been put on large clients with multi-state returns, and many things I haven‚Äôt seen before (Which I‚Äôve disclosed). I‚Äôve tried my best to learn; but everything takes me longer, I‚Äôm still perfecting and trying to make my work papers clean, and I feel like I‚Äòm not doing good enough :( During engagement meetings I try and take very detailed notes - but I feel like I always miss something. Or my work papers aren‚Äôt done quite the right way for the reviewer - or I just misunderstand what should be done. I want to ask more questions, but I either feel too stupid or don‚Äôt know what to ask (Like I think I do understand something - when in reality I don‚Äôt) Most of the smaller returns I've worked  on I‚Äôve gotten good feedback on. I haven‚Äôt gotten any bad feedback so far - I can just know that it takes a lot more patience to work with me on bigger projects/ returns right now and certain reviewers probably get frustrated with me. I‚Äôve started to get anxiety while I‚Äôm working again and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm meeting expectations. I don‚Äôt feel like I can turn down work since I still am trying to prove myself and work with a variety of people - I‚Äôve taken maybe 2 actual days of PTO since busy season ended and I‚Äôm just feeling stressed. I‚Äôm just trying to keep pushing through knowing that maybe there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. It‚Äôs so frustrating after being in accounting as a staff for almost 3 1/2 years to feel this way, is accounting even what I want to pursue? Will I ever get better? I really want to be a CPA but I just feel like I‚Äôm too stupid. I feel like all my friends are getting promoted and doing amazing and their jobs just love them. I‚Äôm 25 and I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ever going to be successful :( 

It‚Äôs been a rough year for me with personal tragedy occurring in the middle of busy season as well. I‚Äôm in therapy to work on managing my busy schedule (both personally and at work) as well as work through some childhood trauma.

2283,"I‚Äôm so beyond grateful for the support of my family, friends, and boyfriend and their words of congratulations to me. A small part of me thinks ‚Äúyeah I did that, I accomplished it,‚Äù but the bigger part of me doesn‚Äôt know why I feel nothing.

My time as a piano major was extremely stressful, not in the academic way but in a personal way that was tied to my professors. After graduating from my two year college, my private instructor there cut me off completely. It was confusing because we were so close, she was someone I told everything to. My last conversation with her, I revealed to her that my sister was taken by CPS and I was diagnosed with RA. I tried to follow up with her but she never responded. I don‚Äôt resent her for it, I‚Äôm still very confused and hurt that after 2-3 years of talking to her almost everyday, she refused to say hello or even ask how I was doing after transferring to university.

Almost immediately after moving away from family to continue my studies, I learned about my sister and CPS and it impacted my ability to focus or perform, which is huge since I was literally a performance major and I was performing every week. I thought I had gained trust with one of my piano professors, so I told him what was going on. He was so supportive until my last day of class when he told me how disappointed he was in my final class performance but that he would still give me an A out of pity for me. That should‚Äôve made me feel grateful but I felt so humiliated. In my last year at university, my new private lesson instructor made me feel like I had learned nothing while at school, saying I wouldn‚Äôt pass my recital hearing (basically a test to see if I‚Äôm ready to perform my senior recital) and even threatening my graduation date. He would also say things like ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt made any progress‚Äù but in the same breath tell me I‚Äôve come a long way, which confused me. Small things like that added up to an entire list, most of which is made up of negative commentary.

Now I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I deserve only praise. I‚Äôm well aware that I‚Äôm not a prodigy and that I‚Äôm not going to make a career out of performing because it‚Äôs not something I feel I have the constitution for. Sure, I enjoy the occasional performance especially in front of audiences that are supportive and want to hear what I have to share. I actually just had my debut in Colombia in April where I got to teach a masterclass and then perform in the concert hall in front of 500 people. They were so incredibly kind and they are still reaching out to me to tell me how much they loved hearing me play.

So why, after seeing my own progress and being happy with how I progressed, especially as someone in a field where there are so many incredible and inspiring musicians, do I feel like I didn‚Äôt do what I was supposed to? I used to be so proud of the music I shared because I genuinely felt like I was meant to do this, but then hearing these professors who used to attend Juilliard and Curtis and had well-established careers that I‚Äôm a disappointment made me feel like no matter how hard I try, I‚Äôll never be worthy of praise. And now that I have my degree, all I can think about is the pain associated with my years at college.

2284,"The greatest example of this is my time as co-officer for a competition team with my best friend in high school. During our covid-era senior year, we didn‚Äôt think the team would survive the pandemic, but we couldn‚Äôt imagine our final year of high school without the club and decided to fight through the obstacles. While I helped with a few things throughout the year, like student outreach and public speaking ""coaching"", my friend did the bulk of all the work. She contacted the competition org for coach recs, scheduled scrimmages for us with other schools, signed our team up for the competition without school permission (which ended up being one of the most rewarding risks we‚Äôd ever taken), and so much more. She worked nearly every day to ensure we were prepared. I knew that I wasn‚Äôt nearly as stressed as my friend was, but I'm afraid she never brought it up because this was the club that made us closer. At the end of the season, we were in the top 5 at our state competition, and I‚Äôve brought this up at every job interview since.

More recently, during my freshman year of college, I became friends with a girl in one of my classes, and we decided to start a book club together. Out of the 3 officers, I significantly did the least amount of work. I focused on the club‚Äôs social media, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. The other two were making weekly powerpoints, reserving rooms for our meetings, and deciding on the prompts we posted. While I attended the meetings, I stopped writing for the club after the first semester. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for me to take credit for either of these achievements, even though my name is connected to both.

The couple times I‚Äôve partaken in competitions alone this year, I didn‚Äôt receive any awards or see potential for growth.

2286,"so hi! i (18F) am about to graduate from high school next week and in our country's curriculum, we have this so called ""honor roll"" which basically measures how well you performed in school.

ever since i started schooling, i was a consistent honor student and i took pride in my abilities, especially in academics. come 11th grade, i got a 79 (which is kind of a C+ in american grading system) for the first quarter in my statistics subject. i thought i was still able to get into the honor roll as i really studied hard in the second quarter and my final grade for the subject was an 83 (equivalent to a B). for context, one of the criteria before for being an honor student in my school was to not get a FINAL grade lower than 80, but they changed it to a QUARTERLY basis, hence i did not qualify anymore.

i still excelled in my remaining subjects for the rest of the school year in 11th grade, and even got higher grades in 12th grade. yet i still won't get that award on my graduation and it honestly sucks because even if i know i only lacked in ONE subject for ONE quarter, i feel like i am a fraud now and it has really disheartened me especially now that my graduation is near. my parents even congratulated me and told me that it isn't a bad thing but i feel like they're saying it out of pity. i just want to ask if what i'm feeling right now is impostor syndrome?

I got in with the lowest accepted GPA in my very small class. School was rough, but no exams were failed aside from one where I was pushed through for being 1/5th of a percentage point off from passing the class, and this was common in my program for profs to find extra half marks in their work for kids who were close to the next letter grade. Now that I am graduated and in my career I am good at my job, I keep trying to improve and demonstrate good work ethic, I love my job and my co workers appreciate me for what I bring to the table. But I still think every day that this is not something I earned. What can I do to deal with this feeling? Do I need to find a new career and earn it by merit or should I just focus on being as good of a professional as I can in my current career?

I was away for a week and I keep on thinking that when I am back, my boss is going to realise he does not really need me because he managed without me.

This is absolute torture. I am completely aware that this is a stupid and ridiculous thought (... is it?) but I seriously cannot help to wonder.

Life is a long path with multiple branches all leading to the same ending. Yet each path has so many branches that it's nearly impossible to see what each path has to offer. Stick to one path, and love every moment of it because we don't know what's in store for us.

We can plan out our lives and think we know what will happen, but life has a way of throwing us curveballs. This is something that Otto Landyn Meyer, born at the cusp of the new millennium, knows all too well. His parents and grandparents had planned out his entire life for him. They knew his name years before he was conceived, and knew what his profession would be. But life had other plans.

This episode (and season) deal with the difficulties of choosing your own life vs. following the life your family (and society) have groomed you to have. It deals with Imposter Syndrome, and the feelings of self doubt from creating content while alone. I post this here as this follows some of my own journeys and tribulations with Imposter Syndrome, and I hope some of the things characters learn and do might be able to help you, too.

I have had severe imposter syndrome since returning to work after an 18 month maternity leave over Covid.

I was offered a new position at a different place and entered into the role excited and was given no on-boarding whatsoever and have continued to spiral into these feelings of being terrible at my job, incompetent, and even stupid.

2330,"Basically I've been working for a Fortune 500 for the last 3 years (straight after completing Bachelors). I've made 2 promotions and I frequently am involved in situations where things feel and basically are relatively easy to me, yet for the company it feels as if I've invented the wheel.  
 
I don't mean this in an arrogant way at all, as I like to learn and am working in an environment where I feel I still need and can learn a lot. However, I am always treated as 'the outperformer' when realistically, I have no clue why that is.  
Things to me really feel and make sense in my head and I often cannot imagine no one else considered some of the solutions/options I come up with. I've always gotten feedback from multiple managers I have had in those years that I absorb information like a sponge. Basically explain it to me once and I understand it will enough to not only understand it, but understand how certain changes in process or down-/up-stream systems might impact one another. And all of my understanding, how I work, all of that. It is just something I make up myself, the way I structure problem statements, the way I present my PPT slides, the way I structure my PPT deck... people are often impressed but most of the times I've just jotted something in a deck 30 mins prior to the meeting.  

It is not that I have 10+ years of background or have done extensive studies or anything. It feels as if it doesn't cost me effort... yet I am constantly afraid I am not doing well enough or that I should have progressed in my career at a faster pace as what I actually am. I'm struggling with trying to put in writing exactly what it is I feel.  
I'm very amibitious and feel responsible for things that are way above my paygrade. I really don't mean to come across like a smart-ass or something like that.  


I often feel like co-workers, managers and other senior managers view me as some extremely talented individual, where I for the life of me cannot understand why. I even addressed this today during a one on one with my manager. I basically explained how it feels as if I am not performing well (hard skills) and that I am not doing my job well (in soft skills). He just started laughing and said things like ""if what you're doing is not good enough, we will all be jobless, ha-ha!"".  

The higher I am 'climbing' this corporate ladder, the more I get this feeling of literally being an imposter. Like what is it that justifies me earning my pay, how is what I am doing special? How is my best friend who works as a nurse, literally helping people daily, is getting a third of what I get... I sit in calls all day, make fancy PowerPoints and literally spend months on solution designs with the same senior people, having to explain things so many times. I really enjoy the work I do, but it sure as hell feels like one day I will be dropped like a brick. And I've seriously got no clue what would make them want to fire me.  

I truely believe this is imposter syndrom and I tried reading about it, but I just don't know how to deal with this. How can I manage this anxiety or where do I start with tackling this feeling?  

I appreciate any help or anything that has helped you deal with this. I look forward to any comments. Apologies if it is not a very well structured post, it has been a mind-dump and I notice I find it difficult putting my thoughts/feeling into words.

2331,"I didn't always have the self-esteem to claim that I was an intelligent person, but throughout my childhood, adolescence, and early youth, I did have some flashes of brilliance that made me feel confident in my abilities.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

Due to my grades I thought it would be difficult for me to find a job, but I quickly got a position as an engineer, and two years later I am still in the same company where I have a position with a high technical profile.

In my day to day I obviously interact with my team, where at the level of academic trajectory, I am clearly at the bottom, if not in the last place. It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

Where I want to get at is that I feel like I ended up here by sheer miracle or by a whim of fate. If I have to be honest, I get to understand the concepts that I work on, but I feel that sometimes it is more difficult for me than others. I like to put this down to the fact that my education wasn't as demanding as theirs, but I do make mistakes sometimes and torture myself. I make some really stupid mistakes, and well, one is fine, but at the end of a project I go through the code and models, and I see a bunch of stupid bugs.

2332,"Hi everyone! I am new here. So, I was on a law students reddit page a while ago and came across the term Imposter Syndrome. I got curious and googled the term. After that, I searched and took Imposter Syndrome quizzes online (I know its not reliable but I just want to see how I fair) and turns out that every single one of the quizzes I took said I have a high tendency or possibility of having Imposter Syndrome.

Looking back, I think I identify with the signs of having it. I have been an achiever since I was a kid. I was a consistent Honors Student (Straight As) from Elementary to High School. In college, I did well too. I was consistent Deans List and graduated Cum Laude. I was Managing Editor of our College Newspaper and competed and won regional and national titles in Journalism competitions. 

Went to law school and did fairly well again. Took the bar only once and passed. I was a lawyer before I was 30. 

My whole life I was expected to accomplish high feats. People see me as an achiever. But to be honest, I dont see myself as such. I always think that I might be good but someone will always be better than me. I always think that I should have accomplished more rn at my age but i havent. I feel like all other friends, classmates I had have already come a long way.

I feel like whenever I make a mistake, people starts talkingbehind my back and talk/gossip abt me not being good at what I do. I feel like all the accolades and hardwork I did doesnt really make me capable. I dont like talking abt my achievements or being complimented coz I feel embarrassed. I just wanted to be lowkey. I remember passing the bar and when I was congratulated I said I was just lucky. 

I thought all these are just normal and a part of me being the introvert that I am. But when I came across the term ""Imposter Syndrome"" and read abt it felt like a glass shattered (like in HIMYM episode called ""Spoiler Alert"" lol) and it all kind of become clearer to me. I dont know who to talk to abt this so I looked for a group here on reddit hoping to get to discuss or maybe help me understand abt this more.

2335,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""...

Almost every time I'm interested on something, say sports, music, reading, I get this weird feeling that I'm faking everything, which makes me feel bad when talking to other people about those interests and also while I'm focusing on them.

It's like I think I'm supposed to know everything about something if I'm interested in it. Otherwise I'm just posing.

Just to give an example, there's this rock band I love and some years ago I showed them to my mom and more recently showed her their new album. On the other day my mother told my about this oldie song from them which I didn't know. It is an awesome song, but at that very moment I started feeling like a poser, because if I don't know that song then I don't really know anything about the band and I don't really enjoy them, I'm just faking.

This pattern has happened with almost every interest I get. I love talking to people about my interests and teach things about them, but when the opposite happens I start feeling like I'm a fraud and I'm just pretending to be more interesting than I actually am.

2362,"Quick, who is your favorite author?

One of my favorite authors right now is Michael Wickett. He's an accomplished Nightingale-Conant motivational speaker and author. His book, ***It's All Within Your Reach*** is one of the best I've ever read.

I hold him in high regard because of that book.

Most, if not all of us, feel the same way when it comes to authors. Statistically speaking, about 80 percent of the American population wants to write a book, but so few embark on this journey. If I had to guess, I would probably say that many people do not believe they have what it takes to write a book, which, at the root is simply fear. But, I once heard Les Brown say, ‚ÄúWhen your why is big enough, you will find you how.‚Äù

I‚Äôm going to lay out 10 reasons why you should write a book and maybe, just maybe after you read them, you will find you how, and if not, I promise to help you.

## Reason #1: A book is an instant confidence booster

As I mentioned at the outset, how do you normally feel about authors? Do you treat them differently from the average person? What sort of impression do you get when you're introduced to an author?

When people perceive you in a high and elevated way, you begin to feel better about yourself. It‚Äôs an instant confidence booster. Most people treat authors as celebrities. And imagine if your book hits Amazon's #1 Best-Seller Status. What would that do to your confidence and self-esteem?

I know I felt great when mine hit that status. Not in a prideful or boastful way, but just proud of myself and what I‚Äôve accomplished since the death of my mom. I know she would be proud of me as well.

## Reason #2: A book allows you to see your value and potential

Author John Maxwell said, ‚ÄúMany people fail to grow and reach their potential because of low self-esteem.‚Äù

When I was depressed and contemplating suicide, my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I could not see any value or worth in my life. But I was motivated by the thought of a postage stamp and so I began to add value to my life, first by exchanging my negative thinking for more positive ones, I began to exercise, eat healthier and start back fellowshipping with my congregation.

When I began to write, I learned to get out of my head and to see my real potential and value as a human being. If you don‚Äôt realize you have genuine value or that you're worth investing in, then you‚Äôll never put in the time or effort required to grow.

One of my favorite motivational speakers Zig Ziglar said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with how we see ourselves. We can positively do very few things if we feel negative about ourselves.‚Äù

I know for a fact, that every aspect of our lives is directly impacted by the way we see ourselves. When you write and pour out your heart onto paper, you see how far you‚Äôve gotten in life, and all that you've accomplished.

## Reason #3: Writing a book is an opportunity for self-reflection

Have you ever gone to therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. Going to therapy helped me cope with being sexually molested as a young girl. Well, I get that same type of help every time I sit down to write. Writing allows you to dig deep within yourself. You are alone and vulnerable and you're able to work things out on paper that you can‚Äôt do when they stay locked up in your head.

Writing forces you to reflect on your life. Most of the time, when we take the time to self-reflect, we see patterns that we need to change and habits we need to develop.

When I was in the fifth grade, my amazing teacher, Mrs. Battle brought a snake into the classroom and we had the privilege of seeing the snake shed its skin. It was the absolute most captivating thing I‚Äôd seen at that time. When I write, I also see myself shedding my old skin, my old thinking, and my old dishonoring ways for a newer, better version of me.

Writing has allowed me to change my life and the byproduct of that is I‚Äôve changed the way I think about myself. I no longer see myself as a victim. I am strong and unbreakable. By the way, so are you.

Our lives are so hectic. Learning to pause allows growth to catch up to you.

## Reason #4: Writing a book allows you to flex your brain power

Did you know that our brains weigh about three pounds? It is such a small organ, yet it packs a punch. When you write, even when you're writing your own story, inevitably you will have to do some research, whether that be interviewing your family members or hopping onto Google to get some facts or now, AI ChatGPT.

Our brains are muscles. Just like any muscle it needs to be flexed or it will atrophy. Writing allows you to flex your brain. When you step outside of your comfort zone you give yourself a chance to explore new things about yourself. One new point discovered can lead to other points and you never know where that can take you. I‚Äôve learned that to be a success, you first have to think it and the only way you start to think it is, either you change or something in your life forces you to change.

Nothing in life remains the same forever.

Writing helps you to determine your future. You can write your ticket in life or continually allow someone else to force you to write theirs. Stop thinking in terms of ‚ÄúCan I‚Äù and start thinking in terms of ‚ÄúHow Can I.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow Can I‚Äù puts a different spin on things. It‚Äôs the beginning of a high-value question that prompts you to figure it out. Start asking the right questions and your brain will begin to give you better answers.

## Reason #5: A book is an ideal way to create side-hustle income

Most people that I come into contact with would love to someday work for themselves, whether it's for financial freedom or just because they want to spend more time at home with their family.

When you write a book and you get the title of #1 best-selling author attached to you, people are going to take notice.

Published authors are considered experts and authorities in their field. If you had a book, do you think you could send that book to a business prospect? How do you think you would be perceived by that person? Would it be difficult to land that contract? I don‚Äôt think so.

Writing a book positions you as an authority. This fact can help you sell more products and services which will ultimately impact your bottom line.

Would you like to earn more money just by writing a book?

That would be a yes for me too.

Just think, what if you were allowed to get paid for sharing with other people information you already know?

Now, perhaps unlike at any other time in history, if you possess knowledge that other people would be willing to pay for, you can start making money, with little or no startup costs, especially with the help of AI.

Teaching online grants you the freedom to still work a day job yet generate side-hustle income. Today, it‚Äôs a real possibility to even make just as much money while you're asleep as when you're awake, thanks to the power of the Internet and AI.

You have the opportunity to teach and share what you're most passionate about with large audiences. Would you like to share what you love and be paid for doing so?

So now are you beginning to see how finally earning what you‚Äôre worth by sharing your knowledge and expertise with others would help boost your self-confidence and self-esteem?

## Reason #6: A book will help you get over your fears, even your fear of public speaking

Have you ever noticed that authors are usually asked to speak at conferences or seminars? Well, my friend, the same will be true for you. I know, but you‚Äôre afraid of speaking, right?

Well, the only way to face any fear is to stand up to it. We overcome our fears by doing the thing that we fear. Here are three other ways to overcome fear:

* Define your fear. When we face new situations in life, we normally imagine the worst-case scenario. But, did you know that you can dramatically shrink your fears by simply putting them into words on a piece of paper? See how writing helps you to slay fear.
* Accept the challenges that fear presents to you. Instead of shrinking back and giving fear the upper hand, accept fear as a normal part and life and act despite it. A great tool from author and speaker Mel Robbins of The 5 Second Rule, really works. Try it. When you want to do something, just count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and then do the thing that you fear. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ‚ÄúDo one thing every day that scares you.‚Äù
* Think of the benefits of acting in the face of your fear. Think of what it will do for your self-esteem and self-confidence. A good exercise is to physically write down the benefits you will gain by forging ahead. The thing to remember is that every decision you make is helping to form the person you are becoming. Do you want your fear to define you or do you want to take that scary risk and come off the victor?

## Reason #7: A book will help you be more productive by raising your standards

Do you find that you are easily distracted and not being as productive as you can be? Well, writing a book during a challenge will not only help you with your productivity it will also help you with developing discipline, determination and just plain grit.

When you write a book, it‚Äôs just you, the blank slate, and now AI. Writing helps you remain singularly focused on the task at hand. It is an exercise in discipline and time management. If you stick to it, your determination will give way to a beautiful masterpiece. And no, it doesn‚Äôt have to take months anymore, it can take a weekend. I will show you how to write 10 books in 30 days.

Let me ask you a question, what's the difference between something you should do and something you absolutely must do?

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, ‚ÄúThe things easy to do are also easy not to do.‚Äù In other words, the things you should do are things that are easy not to do and so you don‚Äôt do them. Some of these things are:

I should eat healthier.

I should exercise more.

I should treat my spouse with respect.

But when you absolutely must do something, as if your life depended on it, there is a shift and change in you. If eating healthier meant you would live or die, then you most likely would do it. The same with exercise and treating your spouse with respect, if your life depended on it, you would make the necessary changes.

When you raise your standards and turn ‚Äúshould‚Äù into ‚Äúmust,‚Äù you are making an inner shift to take control over the quality of your life. Any area in which you are not getting what you want is because you haven‚Äôt raised your standards.

According to Tony Robbins, ‚ÄúMost people, if they look at how they are living their lives today, will find that their identity is based on a set of standards and a set of beliefs they created 10, 20, 30 or more years ago. Many of us made decisions when we were kids about what to believe, what we are capable of, and who we are as a person, and that became the glass ceiling that controls us. But are you the same person you were back then? Are you the same person you were even a year ago?‚Äù

I‚Äôm just going to say it, you have to demand excellence from yourself. Don‚Äôt be mediocre. Be world-class. Don‚Äôt settle for the status quo, be relentless. Pursue excellence. ‚ÄúPeople are rewarded in public for what they‚Äôve practiced for years in private,‚Äù said Tony Robbins. Never ever give up. Raise your standards. Writing will help.

## Reason #8: A book will help you develop bullet-proof habits

To complete your book, you have to have good habits, otherwise, you‚Äôll never get it done.

In 2008, after my mom died of colon and liver cancer, a few years later, I developed the habit of getting up at 4 a.m. and going to the gym. That habit has helped and sustained me all these years. I knew I had to do something to get my mind out of the loop of negativity. I knew I had to physically move my body because where my focus goes, energy flows.

With that said, I started researching other high achievers and came across Brendon Burchard. Brendon has been studying high achievers for over 20 years and the biggest secret he has learned when it comes to habits is ‚Äútrigger moments.‚Äù

In essence, trigger moments are cues that remind you to activate your intentions or habits.

I use my iPhone to create my trigger moments. A lot of people underutilize this great feature on their iPhones. Right now, I want you to take your ‚ÄúClock‚Äù then hit ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù and then add your alarm time. Then under ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù write out your goal ‚Äì the same one you have a picture of on your board. Press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. Repeat this step three times for each of your goals. So from now on, every day at that time, you‚Äôll be reminded to accomplish your goals. This is how you attack from all sides. You have the vision board, you have the alarm and now let‚Äôs move on to tip number three.

My all-time favorite bullet-proof habit device is pen and paper. When we track what we do, things get done. As an example, I started using my Apple Watch to track how many steps I take in a day. Before I had this device, I never walked 10,000 steps, but now that I track it, I make sure I do it every day. The same is true with any habit you form. When you write it down and track it, you will see the needle move, your results will encourage you to continue going. This helps to build momentum and you will become unstoppable. Writing has a funny way of doing that.

## Reason #9: A book helps boost your self-esteem and allows you to expect more out of life

Scientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But today, they‚Äôre learning more and more that we respond to what the brain expects to happen next.

Neuropsychologists call it the expectancy theory. Basically, through a lifetime‚Äôs worth of events, our brains learn what to expect next ‚Äì even if it does not happen. And because our brain expects something will happen a certain way, we often achieve exactly what we anticipate.

Do you see the dilemma?

If you don‚Äôt expect much to happen in your life, then, most likely it won‚Äôt. But if you do expect something great to occur, it most likely will. The difference is that you have to believe it will happen to you.

But how do you get that belief?

Simply put, you need to build your confidence.

**Confidence is built through action.**

A great start is simply writing down on a piece of paper, what it is that you want and expect out of life. When you put into words what you are thinking in your head, it becomes real. You now have a way to make a plan and start seeing some forward movement in your life.

In a talk at TEDx San Francisco, Mel Robbins, self-help author of the book, The 5 Second Rule, mentioned that scientists estimate the probability of your being born at about one in 400 trillion.

Do you know what that means?

It means you are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal pride. You are extraordinary. There has never been anyone exactly like you in all history of mankind on the earth. You have amazing untapped talents and abilities that, when properly directed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want or dream of.

In essence, your very existence proves you are a miracle. So start acting like the miracle you are!

In a CD by Earl Nightingale, titled, The Strangest Secret, he says, ‚ÄúYou become what you think about.‚Äù So what are you thinking? What are you constantly feeding your mind on? Your mistakes or your accomplishments?

Your thoughts trigger images and pictures and the emotions that go with them. These images then trigger your attitudes and actions. Therefore, if you think about success, you will feel strong and competent, but when you think about your mistakes, you will inevitably feel sad and weak.

We attract into our lives that which we think about. Whatever our dominant thoughts are, that is what will show up for us in our lives. To have more self-esteem you need to think the thoughts you would be thinking if you were already achieving your goal. Writing is a great place to start.

## Reason #10: A book helps you create and leave a legacy for your friends and loved ones

When my mom died, I wished she would‚Äôve written a book, just a story about every aspect of her life that I failed to ask about. She was an extraordinary woman that I didn‚Äôt have enough time with. I do however have a few of her songs. She was an amazing songwriter, and that‚Äôs where I get my ability to write. Thanks, mom.

When we leave this earth, a few mementos and memories are all we have left of our loved ones. What if you had more? What if you had a book that detailed the lives of your mom, dad, grandparents and more? What if you left that to your children and relatives? How would they feel? How proud would they be? Could it perhaps encourage them to confidently go after their hopes and dreams?

I believe writing a book helps create your legacy. In our digital age, there's no telling who else will be touched and inspired by your thoughts and words. At the outset, I asked who was your favorite author or writer, what if they never wrote down that very thing that inspired you?

I believe we not only owe it to ourselves to write a book, but we owe it to the universe and the generations coming behind us. Do what author Steven Pressfield suggests in his book, The War of Art. In the last pages of his book, he says that if you don‚Äôt do the thing you were meant to do, you, not only hurt yourself, you hurt the planet. He says, **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you got.‚Äù**",Quick favorite author One favorite author right Michael Wickett Hes accomplished NightingaleConant motivational speaker author book Within Reach one best Ive ever read hold

2366,"The dictionary defines self-awareness as ‚Äúknowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.‚Äù 

When you‚Äôre self-aware, you have an accurate and clear understanding of your character, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs and sense of self. You know what your life is about, you know how others perceive you and the effect you have on them.

Why does it matter?

Your level of self-awareness influences the key pillars in your life ‚Äì your relationships, career, personal development and overall wellbeing.

¬∑ Self-awareness is necessary for taking control of your life. The direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and reactions. Self-awareness is the principal way of understanding and influencing these things. When you take control, you have choices.

¬∑ Self-awareness identifies un-resourceful beliefs and emotional reactions that stand in your way and gives you the power to make adjustments ‚Äì personal growth.

¬∑ Self-awareness can lead to a greater understanding of past setbacks and challenges. We can conveniently dismiss our failures as bad luck or a lack of proper timing. But it‚Äôs also possible that we failed to perceive the situation, others, or ourselves accurately. It‚Äôs much easier to see the reason behind relationship, work, and other struggles when we can look at ourselves honestly.

¬∑ Self-awareness is critical for successful leadership. Leaders with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses are able to build teams that compensate those weaknesses and leverage the strengths.

¬∑ Self-awareness is the foundation for personal growth. Without it, any personal development efforts will be severely hampered ‚Äì as if you‚Äôre building on sand.  
   
 

# How Can I Develop Self-Awareness?

¬∑ **Develop the habit of Noticing your thoughts.** Our minds are constantly churning through ideas and endlessly providing commentary. Becoming aware of these thoughts, and noticing the common themes gives the potential for encouraging more resourceful self-talk.

‚óã Notice your thinking patterns. What are you thinking when you‚Äôre feeling nervous? Bored? Interested? Walking down the street? ‚Äì what does this mean for you?

‚óã Do you judge people and situations? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future? Do you expect the worst to happen or the best? Or do you adopt an open attitude of, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just see what happens‚Äù?

¬∑ **Notice your feelings.** What are you feeling throughout the day? What do you feel while you‚Äôre eating? Driving to work? Lying in bed? Waiting in line?

‚óã As you notice each emotion, question it. What am I feeling? Why? What do I need right now? How do I normally react in this situation? Is this resourceful for me? 

¬∑ **Reflect on how you deal with frustration or emotional discomfort.** ***A huge chunk of your time is spent trying to make yourself feel better.*** If you feel slightly frustrated or uncomfortable, then you may spend a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to change the situation or the others around you to resolve those negative feelings. Would id be more resourceful to develop your responses ‚Äì which you can control ‚Äì or try to change others ‚Äì who you do not control. 

‚óã Do you try to control others? Do you attempt to distract yourself? Is your first instinct to leave the situation? Do you surf the internet or eat a big bowl of ice cream?

¬∑ **Consider your friendships.** Where do you meet new friends? Are most of your friendships long-term or short? When your friendships end, what is the common cause? What types of people do you prefer to be friends with? What types of people do you avoid?

¬∑ **Consider your intimate relationships.** Do you see patterns in the type of people that you‚Äôve been involved with? What are the common positive and negative characteristics they share? Why do you think those people appealed to you?

‚óã What were your shortcomings in your relationships? Are you clingy? Jealous? Too focused on work? Fail to communicate your needs? Think about how you contributed to the successes and failure of your relationships.

‚óã Have you changed your approach from relationship to relationship, or do you continue to repeat the same patterns?

¬∑ **Keep a journal.** This is a highly effective way to learn about yourself by recording your thoughts, feelings, and experiences each day. Be sure to include your high and low points for the day.

‚óã Note how well you ate and slept, too. Sleep ‚Äì especially changes in sleeping patterns - can elicit very valuable information about what is going on. 

‚óã Create a habit of writing in your journal for at least 15 minutes each day. You‚Äôll start to notice patterns and learn a lot about yourself.

¬∑ **Reflect on your core values.** Think about and then document your core values, goals and intentions. You might be surprised by what you write. This is a great first step for understanding yourself and your beliefs.

¬∑ **Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses.** How do you know? Are you certain? Avoid jumping to conclusions. You may have always believed that you‚Äôre a hard worker, but are you? To whom are you comparing yourself? Provide yourself with proof before you make any decisions. Are you noticing any limiting beliefs ‚Äì I‚Äôm not good enough, I‚Äôm not worthy?

¬∑ **What would others say about you?** Consider how your partner, children, friends, family, co-workers, and boss would describe you. What would they suggest you improve about yourself? How do you respond to thinking about what others think about you?

¬∑ **Trance.** Meditation is all about developing a better awareness of the present moment and yourself. *Meditation is an ideal activity for enhancing self-awareness. Hypnosis / Self-hypnosis is all about using the trance state to support your general wellbeing and specific outcomes.*

‚óã Meditate at least once each day. Spend the rest of the day paying attention to yourself, others, and your surroundings. You can develop a higher degree of self-awareness by just paying attention.

‚óã Question yourself throughout the day.  *‚ÄúWhat emotions am I currently feeling and why?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are the people around me feeling?‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äôwhat is the best use of my time right now?‚Äô‚Äô*",dictionary defines selfawareness ‚Äú knowledge awareness personality character ‚Äù ‚Äô selfaware accurate clear understanding character strength weakness value belief sense self know life know others perceive effect matter level selfawareness influence key pillar life ‚Äì relationship career personal development overall wellbeing ¬∑ Selfawareness necessary taking control life direction life determined thought belief emotion reaction Selfawareness principal way understanding influencing thing take control choice ¬∑ Selfawareness identifies unresourceful belief emotional reaction stand way give power make adjustment ‚Äì personal growth ¬∑ Selfawareness lead greater understanding past setback challenge conveniently dismiss failure bad luck lack proper timing ‚Äô also possible failed perceive situation others accurately ‚Äô much easier see reason behind relationship work struggle look honestly ¬∑ Selfawareness critical successful leadership Leaders understanding strength weakness able build team compensate weakness leverage strength ¬∑ Selfawareness foundation personal growth Without personal development effort severely hampered ‚Äì ‚Äô building sand Develop SelfAwareness ¬∑ Develop habit Noticing thought mind constantly churning idea endlessly providing commentary Becoming aware thought noticing common theme give potential encouraging resourceful selftalk ‚óã Notice thinking pattern thinking ‚Äô feeling nervous Bored Interested Walking street ‚Äì mean ‚óã judge people situation spend lot time thinking past future expect worst happen best adopt open attitude ‚Äú Let ‚Äô see happens ‚Äù ¬∑ Notice feeling feeling throughout day feel ‚Äô eating Driving work Lying bed Waiting line ‚óã notice emotion question feeling need right normally react situation resourceful ¬∑ Reflect deal frustration emotional discomfort huge chunk time spent trying make feel better feel slightly frustrated uncomfortable may spend tremendous amount time energy trying change situation others around resolve negative feeling Would id resourceful develop response ‚Äì control ‚Äì try change others ‚Äì control ‚óã try control others attempt distract first instinct leave situation surf internet eat big bowl ice cream ¬∑ Consider friendship meet new friend friendship longterm short friendship end common cause type people prefer friend type people avoid ¬∑ Consider intimate relationship see pattern type people ‚Äô involved common positive negative characteristic share think people appealed ‚óã shortcoming relationship clingy Jealous focused work Fail communicate need Think contributed success failure relationship ‚óã changed approach relationship relationship continue repeat pattern ¬∑ Keep journal highly effective way learn recording thought feeling experience day sure include high low point day ‚óã Note well ate slept Sleep ‚Äì especially change sleeping pattern elicit valuable information going ‚óã Create habit writing journal least 15 minute day ‚Äô start notice pattern learn lot ¬∑ Reflect core value Think document core value goal intention might surprised write great first step understanding belief ¬∑ Reflect strength weakness know certain Avoid jumping conclusion may always believed ‚Äô hard worker comparing Provide proof make decision noticing limiting belief ‚Äì ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô worthy ¬∑ would others say Consider partner child friend family coworkers bos would describe would suggest improve respond thinking others think ¬∑ Trance Meditation developing better awareness present moment Meditation ideal activity enhancing selfawareness Hypnosis Selfhypnosis using trance state support general wellbeing specific outcome ‚óã Meditate least day Spend rest day paying attention others surroundings develop higher degree selfawareness paying attention ‚óã Question throughout day ‚Äú emotion currently feeling ‚Äù ‚Äú people around feeling ‚Äù ‚Äò ‚Äô best use time right ‚Äô ‚Äô,trust

2373,"I have a Masters in computer science from a relatively prestigious school, and I‚Äôve received praise and awards from respected tech companies.

But‚Ä¶ all I hear are the words of three people:


My Dad - When I got into a top program for a Ph.D in Computer Science he was only disappointed I didn‚Äôt get into MIT.  

When I placed at the top of my college class and won a faculty award for my senior project, he later criticized it saying his idea would have been better and that it didn‚Äôt go anywhere (it did, later years based their work on mine).



My Professor - I wrote a thesis for an honors program, and he was supposed to read and give feedback.  My primary professor loved it and praised me.

This other professor said he wasn‚Äôt convinced, said the entire field (unconventional computing) is a waste, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to get a Ph.D unless you‚Äôre someone ‚Äúlike Hawking or Einstein‚Äù.  He himself was a Harvard grad, and his words really took a toll on me.



My Best Friend - Just regularly puts me down.. calls me ugly, never celebrates my accomplishments and criticizes me instead.  I always do my best to give him support and rarely criticize his work (the rest of the world does that enough).  

But, it feels like he needs to make me feel inferior.  One time I met some new friends, both with a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù  C.S. background, and we started a project together.  My friend immediately snapped and said ‚Äúwell they‚Äôre obviously smarter than you‚Äù.



I just have this constant stream of echos in my head, mostly from these three people, and it kills my confidence.

But, what if they‚Äôre right?  Should I thank them for stopping me from pursuing my dreams with more confidence?

2375,"I‚Äôve always had issues with imposter syndrome but it‚Äôs never been this bad and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I am in my last 3 months of graduate school where I am set to complete a dual masters degree with a dual concentration. My GPA is a 3.8, so on paper it sounds like I‚Äôm extremely intelligent in my field, but in reality I don‚Äôt even know what the day to day work life would look like for someone in my career path. I‚Äôm currently completing my Capstone for my degree and I‚Äôm struggling horribly with writing just the proposal. I have no idea how to write a sound study design and can‚Äôt wrap my head around writing all most 10 pages worth of information on a project that is still far into the future (in terms of data sources, limitations I might have, data analysis). 

When I was in the thick of my graduate curriculum I always received good grades and got things done on time, but I think I just learned how to do homework really well. For example, I was taking my degree at an accelerated rate in order to graduate sooner, so I was completing more classes than was recommended or than what my peers were. Because of this, a lot of the assigned reading/work for each class was doubled so I physically wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete all of it exactly as I should‚Äôve, in a timely manner, while also trying to live a life and working full time. My work around was that I would skim a lot of it, and never do any of the optional or supplemental work. I would give the bare minimum of effort on assignments, in order to get an A or high B. And it worked, like I said I completed my curriculum with a high 3.8 GPA. But now‚Ä¶ I think I really regret not reading everything word for word. I feel like I can‚Äôt even tell you what I learned. 

Now that I am almost done with my degree, which hopefully even freaking happens at this point‚Ä¶ I have to start finding a job. I‚Äôve been applying to 10-20 jobs almost everyday and I can‚Äôt even get someone to give me an in person interview for an entry level position in my field, and I now have THREE advanced degrees. More so, I sometimes try to imagine some of the field related questions they may ask me when I finally do land one, and I LITERALLY can‚Äôt imagine I would know ANY of the answers to anything they may ask. Not to mention, from reading the basic job descriptions I have almost no qualifications‚Ä¶so like why did I even put myself in this much debt for these degrees that apparently mean nothing now?

At this point, I feel like I‚Äôll never succeed in this field, I have dread every day that I‚Äôll horribly embarrass myself in interviews or talks with other similar professionals, and now I don‚Äôt even know if this field was for me to begin with.

2376,"Sometimes it feels like my actions are geared, all of the time, to prove my imposter syndrome right. I applied for a job, genuinely believing I wouldn't receive an invitation to interview. I couldn't sleep the night I applied because I was humiliated at the thought of someone reading my C.V. To my surprise I got a call to interview. Shortly after that call, I told myself that they had already chosen another candidate for the job, and my invitation for interview was only because they had to fulfil a certain quota of interviewees. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well after that either.

Anyway, I performed poorly in my interview today and I didn't get the job. What do you know, my imposter syndrome was right all along. Running narratives like: it was silly of me to apply in the first place, why did I think I would've gotten this anyway, of course they had someone else in mind, I'm not skilled at interviewing so why would I even bother. I remember beforehand sitting in the interview waiting room thinking it's not too late for me to run away, cancel the interview, save the shame. 

What is this (imposter syndrome) about? Is it a perverse sense of self-preservation? Never fully committing to believing in myself, because the fall from grace would be too great? Feeling like I have to run harmful stories about myself, so that I can 'get in' before any threat enters? It doesn't work though. I still feel a bit upset despite 'expecting failure' - maybe because I realise that the way I treat myself is unfair, and ultimately doesn't get me anywhere.

Still, things I'm proud of (because fuck you imposter syndrome):

* I proved I can get to interview stage, gap in C.V. be damned 
* I can get through an interview, maybe not \*successfully\*. But the world didn't end. I'm alive. I'm here. The embarrassment of trying (& trying & failing & trying) won't kill me.
* I have accomplishments that speak for themselves and experiences to back it up. This is actually the objective truth and imposter syndrome can't take that away.
* I'm still breathing.

Right after this doctoral exam I got some very uplifting feedback from one of the professors saying that I impressed him with being able to answer all of his questions - and it felt like for the first time in my life, I had overcome my imposter syndrome. But, I had a job interview yesterday at my dream workplace and I've been crying for hours since. The head of r&d was there together with two section managers, one of them had interviewed me three months ago and initiated this second interview. He warned me on the phone that the head of r&d was going to put me under a lot of pressure with his questions to test me, and that I should not be intimidated by it. During the interview, he asked me so many questions within my field of research, and I just couldn't answer them, because I am embarassingly bad at remembering formulas. I regularly look them up because I simply can't remember even the basic stuff. Stuff like, what is mechanical power? And he could find all my weak spots and was so arrogant, sadistic even, and now I am questioning myself, how did I even end up getting a doctorate in engineering? And the other two interviewing me were so nice, they never would have tested me this way but now they heard how I can't answer high school level physics questions.

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

¬∑ Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‚ÄòBecause I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others‚Äô or ‚ÄòI choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other‚Äôs accomplishments‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards‚Äô. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as ‚Äì by its very nature ‚Äì it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‚Äòus‚Äô and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",think ‚Äô belong think ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô fraud getting idea station ‚Äô worthy really Sound familiar Welcome Imposter Syndrome ‚Äô good company Nigella Lawson Michelle Obama Lady GaGa Lily Allen shared imposter syndrome experience publicly demon ‚Äô umbrella term life one limiting belief generalised one may accompanied specific belief typically formed rationally childhood child may serve u well example ¬∑ need everyone approve ¬∑ valued must succeed everything ¬∑ OK make mistake bad ¬∑ feel happy life without contributing back way ¬∑ Everyone need rely someone stronger ¬∑ ‚Äô feel sadness discomfort pain ¬∑ Someone somewhere take responsibility would list look like However time move thing change become adult childhood belief serve u le well ‚Äì resultant behaviour may incongruent situation lead conclusion one thing mean grow develop childhood belief adopt new set belief serve u better adult progression follows broad pattern developing dependence child independence young adult interdependence mature adult overall set belief developing time However u carry childhood belief u adulthood innocuous time sometimes impede performance high functioning interdependent adult adult benefit identifying limiting belief growing valuable belief way example common limiting belief sitting Imposter Syndrome umbrella ‚Äò must compare others ‚Äô reframed ‚Äò live life term ‚Äô ‚Äò unique set character strength others ‚Äô turn reframed belief underpin valuable affirmation ‚Äò live life enjoy success others ‚Äô ‚Äò choose celebrate success without reference ‚Äô accomplishment ‚Äô ‚Äò fact choose live life authentically mean compare standard ‚Äô standard element working PERMA hypnotherapy developing high degree selfawareness via exploring character strength value belief limiting belief pave way defining identity turn leaf ideally placed choose best future Working hypnotherapist particularly well suited personal development area ‚Äì nature ‚Äì open pathway part know recognise ‚Äò u ‚Äô deeper level wisdom ideal need take big step forward,trust

**Identify and challenge your limiting beliefs.** While they have many guises, most limiting beliefs can be distilled down to two essential beliefs: I‚Äôm not good enough & I‚Äôm not worthy. We may also carry over beliefs from our early years which served us well then but now hinder us as adults.

**Recognize ‚Äì and celebrate - your small victories.** Whatever small victories are meaningful to you. Within the context of having strategic plans, each small step is a victory in itself and also a step towards something so much bigger.

**Take responsibility for your current situation.** When you take responsibility, you take control. And when are in control, you have options and choices.

**Take a step each day toward your ideal self.** We all have the same 168 hours each week ‚Äì that‚Äôs just physics ‚Äì the issue is what we choose to do with them.

When we focus our efforts on what is important ‚Äì in the context of what we have chosen to achieve ‚Äì we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.

**Avoid comparing yourself to others.** This points to the difference between self-esteem (externally focused) and self-worth (internally focused). The only valid comparison is our previous self.

2394,"I work for an audit firm, so far my first and only job. Studying to become a certified accountant, which entails studying remotely whilst working to gain competencies at the same time. This would get me accredited in 2-4 years from now, depending on my academic performance.

For anyone working in assurance, you would know its standard practice to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù associates to audit seniors after 4-5 years, depending on personal performance. This just happened to me. As many in assurance would also know, deadlines are often strict and require frequent overtime. In the 3 going on 4 years I‚Äôve worked, I‚Äôve always felt I‚Äôm falling behind my peers in being able to meet deadlines. However, I prided myself in being competent in the work I do, finding and resolving issues in clients‚Äô financials that other peers wouldn‚Äôt necessarily do. 

The issue is that I think greater importance is being placed on being able to meet deadlines with the bare minimum quality of work by management in order to charge more fees to more clients who wouldn‚Äôt notice a drop in audit quality. Suddenly, after a few months of being an audit senior I feel like I do not deserve my position. Management is constantly on my case about cutting down on time and cost on audits, even though I raised concerns about cutting corners. 

Even though I feel I do my absolute best, I still do not satisfy the higher-ups. The peace of mind I always gave myself of doing high quality work doesn‚Äôt bring me the confidence in my competence it once did. I feel I‚Äôm not deserving of the position management gave me given the difference in where myself and management place our impotance on quality vs quantity.

3. I‚Äôm experiencing discomfort when there is a short and easy way to cut the path in my job, and very much stick to the formal and formality sometimes it seems replacing the real result achievement by routine non-effective actions.
4. When having planned for something and it fails or time changes it feels like if the whole day is lost and performance drops drastically
5. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) Father never actually hugged me in my life so that I remember it
6. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) I also never seen my father kissing my mother in my life
7. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) My father was using high voice on me often and calling me names when I was wrong or if I have lost something, I was afraid of him coming home for some time
8. (maybe a little context helps, tried to self-analyze myself) My mother was making me to practice the music instrument and I like music genuinely but I had to study all the time, had not much of social communication experience outside of a school
9. I have no friends, I had some from school, but those were lost with time
10. When I do my job I tend to overcomplicate
11. I can‚Äôt do the art that I like cause I seem to force myself to be and act as someone else and even if the idea was good in the beginning it spoils quickly as soon as mind takes control over inspiration
12. I can tell looking at photos of me 10 years ago that I perceive myself being more ugly than my appearance really was at that time.

2399,"Hi everyone,

I (fairly) recently got promoted at work, and I‚Äôve been really struggling with what I‚Äôm assuming is imposter‚Äôs syndrome ever since. :( I‚Äôm finding it really really hard. 

My job is research based, originally I was doing more admin tasks and I was quite happy and confident in what I was doing. After my promotion I became more directly involved with conducting the research itself. It‚Äôs a big change in my role and the day-to-day activities in my job.

When I went for the promotion, I kind of worried this would happen. I‚Äôm a people pleaser, I suffer with social anxiety and OCD, so I did think that this might be too much for me, but there was pressure to go for it from colleagues, friends, family etc. I thought getting promoted would look good to others and therefore make me feel better about myself :( 

However now I‚Äôm stuck in the job and I‚Äôm just really struggling. We have deadlines, so I feel like I‚Äôm constantly rushing to finish things. When I rush, I get stressed because the quality of my work isn‚Äôt as good as I feel it should be. I worry there are mistakes that I don‚Äôt have time to rectify, then I worry that the mistakes mean I‚Äôm not good enough to be in this role. I‚Äôm also slower because I meticulously check everything for errors, which I worry doesn‚Äôt look good for my performance, further proving to myself that I don‚Äôt deserve this job. Generally I‚Äôm worried my lack of knowledge is going to be revealed somehow, that there will be some huge problem with my work that I won‚Äôt spot because I‚Äôm not intelligent enough etc. I then worry I‚Äôll get fired from my job. 

I think this is all kind of linked to the OCD. The perfectionism, the meticulous checking like I just can‚Äôt let go. I‚Äôve always struggled with these things, but the imposter‚Äôs syndrome has never been as bad as this. I dread getting up and going to work now, whereas I never used to mind it. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my boss about the struggles a little, but I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself and don‚Äôt want to admit how hard I‚Äôm finding it. 

Does anyone relate to this? Any tips on making it more bearable? I‚Äôm feeling really useless at the moment :(

2412,"Hello everyone, this is a lot because it‚Äôs fairly personal and been building up in my mind for years FYI

I‚Äôve been struggling for the last 2 years with what I call ‚Äúpre‚Äù-Imposter Syndrome. 

To elaborate on my situation. I dream to be an A-List Hollywood Producer. Currently, I haven‚Äôt even begun the process but I literally have exactly what I need to do mapped out to a T and how to get there. 

I‚Äôve done research and am aware of steps A-Z on how to get it done. I have the confidence and belief in myself that I WILL accomplish it. But‚Ä¶

The problem is every time I even THINK about taking step #1, I get hit with an immediate cloud of Imposter Syndrome. But it doesn‚Äôt make any sense for me to feel that way because I‚Äôve accomplished literally nothing yet. 

What goes through my mind are thoughts like:

‚Äúwait who are YOU to do something like this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt deserve the success that‚Äôll come when you do it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt even be successful if you try‚Äù

‚ÄúEven if you do produce a great film who are you to have the success that‚Äôll come with it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were nothing working a normal job before, so why suddenly get the success now? You don‚Äôt deserve it.‚Äù

I‚Äôm fully aware that a lot of it is resistance preventing me to start, but I hate the fact that I feel like I‚Äôm thinking so far ahead without even beginning. So it becomes this weird hurdle of ‚Äúfake‚Äù or ‚Äúpre‚Äù Imposter Syndrome which leads to 2 years of resistance to start. 

How do I combat this? What mindset shift should I make so I can numb these thoughts out?

I've since given up due to lack of feedback or anyone actually reading.

I have it in my head that if they (friends/family) don't want to read it, it must not be worth reading. So why should I bother trying?

2421,"Hello I am new here M (24). I have been a poor student ever since I can remember. I failed 5 grade (who fails 5th grade ffs?). I am not a poor learner or stupid by any means but I was never able to get even average grades. A lot of which had to do with the nature of my dad‚Äôs job. We moved around a lot, including abroad where I lacked proper schooling.

11 and 12 grade are super important in our country because they decide the university you will get in. I was so badly prepared for 11 that I decided to repeat. And when I repeated I failed. I had zero hope of getting anywhere.

But still I applied to every university possible. I knew that would only get into shitty ones. But by an absolute stroke of luck I got into a very good university (top 5 or something). I had an excellent entrance test score somehow and I forgot my result card so they just assumed I passed 11th grade (which I later did but not at the time). Very lucky.

University life was super tough for me. I had to study twice as hard as other to get half the results others were getting. I was so very close to failing multiple courses every semester but somehow I always managed to pass by slimiest of margins. My GPA was only 2.58/4 (that too thanks to COVID) but I graduated in 4 years. Very lucky again.

I started applying for jobs before my last semester even began. I was starting to see how my low GPA was holding me back. Everyone who started applying after me got the jobs they wanted. I was left behind. Felt extremely bad but I kept looking. 

My cousin referred me to a Big 4 firm. They don‚Äôt hire from our university, they only hire CPA or ACCA and i was just a Bsc student. The hiring process is also very tough. Tests and interviews. I gave my best and somehow I cleared it all. Turns out they were very short staffed so they made an exception for me. Very lucky again.

Its been 3 months and the job is going fine. But I do feel dumb compared to others as their knowledge is way more then me. I still do my best, I always pretend that I know shit when in reality I don‚Äôt. I constantly live in this fear that one day I will be exposed and it will all come crumbling down. They will know I just got into university by luck, i got into the firm by luck. In reality I don‚Äôt have the credentials for this job. I failed 5th grade, I failed 11th twice, i hardly passed university.

On the other hand many people who know me believe that i got into university and the firm because my father is somewhat influential. That is absolutely not the case. He dint even know I applied to these place till I got in.

It hurts a lot living with this fear everyday.  I hate this and sometimes want to get out and quit. I have no idea how to over come this fear.

I, 34M, am highly doubting my work competences.
I‚Äôve been reading about imposter and think this is what I have.

Let me give background. I come from a family of High intellectual potentials. Although never tested, both my sisters are diagnosed.
I am very sensitive to the opinion of others.

In school, I always succeeded with little effort. I never hid that I did not work and got many jealousy as a result. So I hid my grades.
In university, I got great grades while my gf, now wife, had a harder time, although we studied the same. (She made the schedule).

I‚Äôm quite sure I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten my degree without her planning.

After my master, I did a PhD, got praise from the jury. But if you ask me, I‚Äôll tell you my research wasn‚Äôt worth it, it contributed 0 to science and only got published because my supervisor was good at writing.

I did a Postdoc but then completely changed field.
I felt inadequate in that job, that I wasn‚Äôt properly qualified for it.
During my postdoc, I passed a teacher certification, which was easy. 
I couldn‚Äôt continue the classes, so I ended up going straight for the jury and received the certification, thanks to my good memories from the previous year lesson.

I did not start working as a teacher, I did something completely different still.
I‚Äôve been doing that job for 3 years. I started mid 2019 and we soon had Covid. I have been unable to resume ‚Äúas before‚Äù. I feel like nothing I do makes a difference so I avoid doing. I‚Äôm failing this job and my boss will soon figure it out. Although so far no one said I was doing an inappropriate job.

I then requested to change position in August. And am transitioning positions currently.

Todays, had a progress meeting and was only told I need to make sure I plan and prioritize better. I know this is a weakness I have. I‚Äôm too ¬´¬†hot¬†¬ª, in the moment.

I procrastinate until last minute and then rush to finish. Mostly because tasks seem impossible. And am not happy because the result is not exactly as I imagined it.

Now I‚Äôm lost.
Is it imposter, am I just incompetent, am I really not organized enough, am I just too perfectionist?
I feel like I‚Äôm exaggerating thinking it‚Äôs imposter.

I‚Äôm thinking of seeking help, but first, how do you tell your wife you feel like a failure undeserving of your position?

2439,"I'm not gonna get into it because I could write a book about it but I've got a lot of mental illness and even being diagnosed with them it's taken me a long time to grasp that I am very different from the people around me. It's been starting to hit me lately, my mom said I'm the weirdest person in the family and I often hear that I'm one of a kind but I take those statements as compliments because I appreciate being my own person but I think the awareness is making it harder to feel normal as myself.

I'm always trying to remind my coworkers to be mindful when they say mean things and I feel like a hypocrite when I do because who am I to correct them even though I make a conscious effort to be mindful. They've told me I can't change the world on my own but they also told me that I don't talk trash which is encouraging. When I'm with my friends I feel like I'm with people who share the same spirituality but I feel like a fraud. I feel like I don't belong no matter where I go. 

When I'm with my boyfriend and I tell him that I love him sometimes it's hard to look him in the eye because I feel like he won't believe me. I can't keep my hands off of him which worries me more that he'll think it's lust when I just love him a lot and I feel a transfer of that energy when I touch him. 

It is the most confusing thing to be so sure about my connection with someone and the solidity of the relationship but to also second guess it knowing that there is no reason to. Having had a toxic relationship in the past where my tunnel vision was so strong that I glorified every flaw and let him warp my being, it's difficult not to worry I'm doing the same thing sometimes but I know I'm not but back then I would've thought the same so how can I ever know.

If you have a chance, could you please answer some of the questions below? Thanks, it is greatly appreciated! :) 

1. Does imposter syndrome affect you daily or does it only affect some aspects of your life (i.e. career, relationship, hobby, etc.)?
2. Do you ever feel a strong desire to run away from your current life? I go through periods in my life where I experience this frequently -- the desire to run away, cut off all contact with everyone I know, and start completely anew. Especially arises when I feel more like a failure. I'm curious whether this is a feeling commonly associated with imposter syndrome or if it's just me and not connected.
3. Have you ever walked away from or given up on something because of imposter syndrome?

2441,"The feeling of being an imposter in me comes from the fact that I'm using skills from a field in which I'm not an expert. I come from an accounting background but I've used artificial intelligence techniques to solve a problem in the accounting field. 

I'm completing my Ph.D. in a couple of months and during these years I've also founded a start-up with my supervisors and other partners selling the output of this research. Things are going pretty well I'd say: I've won awards for my research and the company is increasing revenues and has attracted venture capital funds. 

The problem is: I'm afraid that everything I've done is wrong. I'm terrified that at some point in time, everyone will figure out that my research has a weak spot that makes it useless. The point is that I'm aware that there are some objective problems in the algorithms I make, so in a sense, I really am an Imposter, It's not just me who created a distorted idea of myself. 

And here comes my question: is there always a part of truth in our idea of being a fraud? Or is it just in my case, which is why it makes it so hard for me to overcome it?

2442,"Why now? Why not 14 years ago when I was still a wide-eyed and green junior developer?

It took several discussions with my wife to finally drill down to the reasons. First, my parents taught me perfectionism and that either you're a winner or loser. It's been haunting me ever since, and is probably the root of my Imposter Syndrome. I have this built in mechanism that shuts me down unless I'm at the top of the food chain. Next, the field of cyber security is one of immense talent, and it's honestly becoming very hard not to compare myself with my coworkers. Especially when your bonus is tied to performance and feedback. It gets to the point where my performance anxiety halts any progress I was attempting on a project. And now I'm stressing about my performance evaluations... So why did I choose this job, well it's because I want to be seen as ""the expert"", so I choose difficult jobs that force me to learn. It worked for over a decade until I've reached this point. It's like the Dilbert Principle but applied to anxiety.

I'm at the point where I'm considering taking a massive pay cut just so I don't need to perform; like a boring job fixing shitty bugs in obsolete enterprise code.

It was first postdoctoral position after finishing PhD. I got ADHD diagnosis at 36yo soon after it all went down. In hindsight I see imposter syndrome as an important part of breakdowns. It dented my confidence so much my former employer mentioned it even in termination notice as one of the main reasons for this decision. Naturally, during PhD impostor syndrome was there at all times. Main ""reasoning"" why I'm going to be fired were common ADHD symptoms: forgetting, chaos, lack of planning skills etc. I covered it all by working much more than my peers, hence I felt I don't belong since others didn't have to work that hard to be there. 

Edit: As for my partner, I couldn't take that she offers me a significant help to tackle the issue with the job, so I moved out from her. Yes, I loved her (still do) more than anything, but the impostor feeling of messing up her life because I'm a failure was just too hard to take, so I packed up my shit and left her place.

‚Äî-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I‚Äôve been more insecure than ever lately & I‚Äôm having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‚Äòranked‚Äô #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don‚Äôt always say everything - but let‚Äôs just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it‚Äôs because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‚Äòhonors/cum laude‚Äô grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I‚Äôm not trying to say I‚Äôm absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I‚Äôm not actually super talented, I‚Äôm just good at ‚Äòtaking exams‚Äô + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I‚Äôm neurodivergent and am quite ‚Äòslow‚Äô in understanding things (even if it‚Äôs something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren‚Äôt so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‚Äògrade‚Äô I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I‚Äôm a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

2454,"Hi Reddit.   
I want to caveat this post by saying I know how lucky I am and that I have realised suffering is relative and money does not mean happiness. Not by a long shot. 

On paper life is great. Earlier this year I came up with an idea with some friends and we build this company which we promptly sold (finalising last week). At the same time, ive met a woman of my dreams. Loving, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.   


Last week, I got paid for selling the company. I now have more money than I know what to do with and the love of a beautiful woman. Everything should be great right?   


When I got paid out last Friday I started having panic attacks and questioning my happiness. Not so much if I deserve it but coming to terms that, somehow, for reasons I cant really put my finger on I am not happy. I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in my life at a fairly early age but it has caused me to realise that I didnt even know what I truly wanted.   


I started withdrawing into myself in regards to my relationship almost immediately. Questioning my feelings and thoughts for this person who is changing my life for the better on a daily basis.   


I asked her for some space to try and figure this out and it backfired. Badly. To the point where she is saying I need to figure things out before I can ""have others in my life"".   


I now dont know what to make of it all.

2458,"Hello, I've never posted here so I apologize if this post may sound weird. This year, it feels like I'm not doing as well (my grades are dropping) as I would like in my college courses and I'm starting to doubt literally every aspect of myself, and feel like I shouldn't have come this far. I do not want to drop out of college but I always feel, especially now, like anything I do in math is not good enough, and it's embarrassing because im working on a research project this year with graduate students and yet it seems like I'm completely failing expectations both for myself and others, and it makes me feel like a failure.  I love math and there's no way I'd ever love anything else, even like computer science to be honest so this really concerning. Please let me know if this feels relatable in the slightest.

But.........I feel like a rookie. There are some many new processes and systems to understand and these things take time which isn't always easy to find when you are doing daily fire fighting dealing with sickness, safeguardings, shift cover, being a smiling friendly face of the home with a need to promote it as a business etc etc. Yesterday I was filled with anxiety, today has been better but the lurking fear is there that I will be found out as not able to do the job

I also need to watch what I'm saying to people as my usual line at the minute is, well I'm new and still learning so I don't know all the answers etc etc but I'll try my best

There's so much to learn and I'm committed to that and determined, I can usually harness the anxiety as that's just normal part of growth and new situations but I'm off the back of a bad work experience about a year ago when I got bullied out of somewhere when people played on weaknesses and I didn't think I was supported well or had a good induction

2466,"I‚Äôm kinda realizing a glaring issue I have that tremendously hinders my time management and my school/life balance in general  

I‚Äôm a graphic design major. The first step in every project (or, like, project extension) is research. We research subject matter, connecting themes and concepts, color pallets, design styles, font choices and parings, design techniques etc. It‚Äôs an important part of our process, and then comes sketches and executing our chosen concept. (This all will be relevant in a min)

I‚Äôm in a super competitive design program. Two portfolio review processes not before, but after semesters of design classes. Only 40 of the 400 end up making it. 
It was hell, but it‚Äôs my senior year and I‚Äôm almost finished. I used to really like graphic design, I was passionate about it. I worked my ass off to make it through the portfolio reviews.  I think I placed my whole identity and self worth in my ‚Äòdream career‚Äô. I had so many anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns during the portfolio review portion of this degree (the first 2 years). Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about passing the review, but I think i was mentally in fight or flight mode for so long that my brain is still recovering and something isn‚Äôt quite right. 

Despite making it through both reviews, My confidence is shattered. I second guess every decision I make. Everyone around me is so talented and I feel like a fraud. I‚Äôve worked really hard to get here, but I‚Äôm so burnt out I can barley function. I have pretty strong negative associations with school, class, my work, and myself. 


Every single night, we have assignments and things we need to present in the next class. And every single night, the same cycle repeats.

I research, research, research. I spend hours stuck gathering inspiration, jotting down concepts, all because I‚Äôm afraid of moving onto the next step. I don‚Äôt eat meals, I don‚Äôt spend time with friends, and I‚Äôm not even doing any of the ‚Äòreal‚Äô work until my internal clock kicks in maybe around 3 AM or in the morning before class. It‚Äôs always rushed together and I‚Äôm never proud of it. Because I‚Äôm never proud of my work, doing homework the next day becomes even harder. My brain does NOT want to move past the research step. Ever. I never feel ready. I loop myself into a constant cycle of spending WAY to much time on a meaningless first step, neglecting the important work, and feeling shitty about myself. I‚Äôll be on my laptop after hours of throwing together pages and pages of mood boards I will hardly use, still doing the same thing and mentally screaming at myself to stop and I can‚Äôt. I never do, until the very last minute where I‚Äôll have no other choice to.
I am self aware that this isn‚Äôt helping me, and yet every time in the moment I‚Äôll still subconsciously justify it by convincing myself ‚Äòat least I‚Äôm being productive rn, I‚Äôll move on to the next step soon."" (It‚Äôs never soon) Im so upset at myself because I know if I could actually manage my time I‚Äôd have have the time to get everything done that I need to and still enjoy things like spending time with people, making meals, getting enough sleep, etc. I have the time to make quality work, too. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt let myself do any of that. 

I‚Äôve pulled 5 all-nighters in the first 4 weeks. I‚Äôve already missed 3 classes and been 30 min late to 2. Again, I don‚Äôt hang out with friends, I hardly ever eat full meals, i don‚Äôt go to parties or bars or play video games or any of that. It feels like this is all I do and my work is never good and I‚Äôm just making myself miserable. I‚Äôm so upset at myself and I deeply regret the hours and hours I waste on a daily basis.

My entire college experience has been like this, except at some point I was actually motivated by a love for graphic design. At this point I just want it to be over. I‚Äôm so tired, I feel defeated. There‚Äôs no way this is even a viable career option for me if I can‚Äôt even balance my projects in college. 


Sorry if this seemed really dramatic, I didn‚Äôt sleep last night.

2467,"For some context, I was super driven after graduating college(around 7 years ago) to land something at one of the FAANGs, I mean who isn't right? After a point I‚Äôd just do it for laughs, but last time I did(not a FAANG but pretty up there! about 4 months ago), I landed an interview. My reaction? I was laughing, OUT LOUD and kinda ready to fall flat on my face during this process (Thought it would be one hell of an experience). It was supposed to be a very thorough process with 5, FIVE different rounds! as I was told. Well I did the first one ready to be rejected right away(even though I was prepping hard). To my surprise, I received an email with the schedule for the next one a couple days later while I was still working. if you‚Äôre curious about what my response was - I took sometime to read the email over and over again just to make sure this was not just a hallucination, walked straight from my home office to my bedroom and did my happy dance LOL

In summary, I wasn‚Äôt hoping to get in at all since I didn‚Äôt apply with the intention/drive to making it. Given that they absolutely destroyed me in the last one, I was now ready for a very generic rejection email. But hear me out - I GOT IN PEOPLE! I GOT IN FOR REAL THIS TIME AND ENDED UP WITH MAJOR IMPOSTER SYNDROME. I‚Äôve been here for about 3 months now and everyone on my team is so, SO good at what they do and I‚Äôm afraid to look stupid everyday. It is so hard to believe that I made it.

2469,"It occurred to me earlier today that this is an opportunity to prove to myself that I‚Äôm not an imposter and I can and should be doing this job, but the truth is I don‚Äôt believe that and I can‚Äôt stop freaking out about it. 

I always get nervous about presentations and talks but this is a whole other level. I‚Äôve been feeling sick and dizzy since I agreed to it (why oh why did I agree to it - oh yeah, because if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd feel like an even bigger imposter), I‚Äôve had a tension headache for a few days now, last night I woke up the pain was so bad, and it‚Äôs like my whole body is just really tense all the time and I have this constant sense of dread that I cannot shake.

Maybe I have anxiety. If I don‚Äôt feel better after the presentation I‚Äôll go to the GP.

I think what‚Äôs making it worse is it‚Äôs with my boss (or in front of him) and I already feel like he made a mistake hiring me and I‚Äôm not the person he thought I was. I wasn‚Äôt going to apply because I thought it was too much of a step up for me, but my recruiter talked me into it, and by some miracle I did well in the interview. Normally I‚Äôm bad at interviews but know I can do the job. This time it was like I became one of those people who interviews well but doesn‚Äôt really have what it takes to deliver.

It‚Äôs also probably the most objectively important presentation I‚Äôve ever had to do.

I‚Äôve never messed up a presentation before, in fact people have even complimented me on them in the past (I think they‚Äôre pleasantly surprised because I make no secret of how much I hate doing them - to colleagues, not the people I‚Äôm presenting to), but I can‚Äôt help thinking this is the one I‚Äôm going to mess up. It doesn‚Äôt help that my many practice runs still aren‚Äôt great and don‚Äôt seem to be getting better. It especially doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm going to be presenting on Teams, which I‚Äôve never done before, and our whole IT system is changing tomorrow. 

The sad thing is, even if I have another miracle and it goes well tomorrow, I know that won‚Äôt be enough for me to believe I‚Äôm not an imposter and I can and should do this job. I‚Äôll just pass it off as a fluke or dismiss it as inconsequential. There‚Äôs always another way I could fail - another way I have to prove myself.

I know what you're about, great job trying to hide this from everyone for the last 20 years, but time to drop the act.""

And so when this psychologist, by all accounts a good one, tried to help me out of all this negative self-talk, all I could think was ""OK, so they don't see what's ACTUALLY going on with me.

2477,"Alrighty, little background about me. M20, currently going to uni for Health Studies and I‚Äôm in my third year. This year, most of my classes have in personal components, but the last two were all virtually online. Now my issue here is that, I hardly ever try for my classes and I pump out 90 after 90 and keep getting told that I‚Äôm doing so well and get told that they can see that I put effort into my writing. When in actuality, I put a total of 5 hours of effort, the day before it‚Äôs due. Getting this kind of feedback day in and out and then seeing people who ACTUALLY put in the effort getting 60‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs is crushing my mind with guilt and anxiety. I don‚Äôt even tel anyone my average because I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve it, even saying that I get 90‚Äôs while doing literally doing all the work last minute makes me sick to my stomach. 

For example, on a essay I had to write about a social topic of concern, I choose food scarcity. So did 5 other people. Now, I obviously left it to the last minute, threw some things together and BAM, essay done. Everyone else, took the entire 2 months allotted to this assignment that‚Äôs worth 40% of our overall grade to do it. Grades come back and I was fully expecting a 60% and I would‚Äôve been okay with that. Turns out I got a 97% and everyone else, got a 68% or lower. And when everyone asked me how long did I work on it, I felt so guilty telling them that I worked on it for 8 hours before the deadline and got a 30% higher grade when they spent over a month researching and writing and editing. I‚Äôm by no means the smartest person in the room, and I definitely don‚Äôt feel like I deserve the grades that I‚Äôm somehow pulling out of thin air, but I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty over this.

I usually have to stop marking half way through the paper because I'm too scared of what the end score will be that I feel like I can't keep marking to find out. I know that I might get a good score but I'm too scared of getting a bad score so I can't keep marking it.
Another problem is that if an answer is incorrect, sometimes I have to mark it correct just to keep a good score, even though getting that question wrong doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to get a bad score overall. This makes me feel bad because I'm lying, yet I can't seem to stop doing these things.

I'm not sure if that last part fits with imposter syndrome, but it seemed to link with it, sorry if this isn't the case. 
Does anyone have any tips to stop doing this and just stop feeling stupid?",Hi Im mobile formatting may issue feel stupid even though Im predicted mostly typing statement make feel stupid think good grade prove im stupid shouldnt suffering imposter syndrome Also study past paper mark However two problem usually stop marking half way paper Im scared end score feel like cant keep marking find know might get good score Im scared getting bad score cant keep marking Another problem answer incorrect sometimes mark correct keep good score even though getting question wrong doesnt necessarily mean Im going get bad score overall make feel bad Im lying yet cant seem stop thing Im sure last part fit imposter syndrome seemed link sorry isnt case anyone tip stop stop feeling stupid,anticipation

2494,"The title summarises most of this but basically, I get a lot of compliments from people. Like a lot a lot. I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre. Not to say there's anything wrong with being average, I don't mind it,  but,  well,  yeah, I'm average. Yet everyone insists I'm not. It's gotten to the point where I assume that it's because of my disability.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends. I just feel ashamed when people with so many accolades Call ME smart or talented.

2501,"I‚Äôll try to make this quick. I‚Äôm a 20 year old birth doula. If you don‚Äôt know what that means, it‚Äôs a female-only non-medical support career for women giving birth. I‚Äôm trained in physical comfort measures, methods such as hypnobirthing, mediation/emotional support, and advocacy for my clients‚Äô decisions about their labor and birth.

This is a field that has just recently started to grow in popularity, and despite how simple it may sound, certification is a long, hard process. I‚Äôm extremely passionate about the importance of birth and how the idea of it has been corrupted to seem like a medical emergency in every scenario, and modern hospitals routinely abuse mothers in labor. My desire to change this has kept me going for 2 years. I‚Äôm completely trained, yet still uncertified due to the last steps being hands-on experience among other things. The pandemic has kept doulas out of hospitals, making it extremely difficult to find clients for my 3 certifying births, especially as a brand new doula. 

Recently, I‚Äôve taken some steps that have finally led 3 clients to contact me. I‚Äôm aware that all three are mostly interested in my low fee, which is less than a third of what experienced and certified doulas charge. Regardless, I need these 3 births to get certified and begin growing my practice. 

Working with a doula client involves both gathering all information about their pregnancy, birth history, desires for their birth plan, and health information, as well as educating the client on certain decisions, comfort measures, procedures, and birth physiology. There are generally two prenatal meetings preceding the birth and one postpartum meeting afterwords. I‚Äôve held two meetings for different clients. 

It‚Äôs overwhelming having little guidance while jumping into such a large career. No one tells you how to run a prenatal meeting. Your textbook knowledge has to be accurate and unbiased. You have to be intuitive to a laboring woman‚Äôs needs when she can‚Äôt express them verbally. You need to be an expert at active listening and mediation without any personal input or advice.   You need to have thick skin and be open to rejection and criticism from doctors, nurses, clients, other doulas, midwives, and close-minded people who believe there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright‚Äù way to give birth. 

With the lack of support, training, and insight, I slaved over creating an itinerary with minuscule help from Google and a few of my birth books before I ran my first meeting. This is where it gets tough. I know the meeting went well, but I still went home and cried. No matter how much I prepare or how well I know I‚Äôve done, I can‚Äôt make myself believe I actually belong here. After my second meeting, I was 100% convinced that the couple wanted nothing to do with me. That they‚Äôd opted out of wanting a doula after all and they would just ghost me. Of course, this was not the case but it seemed so real in my head. 

At one point, I made an Instagram post about the importance of skin to skin contact directly after birth to meet my ‚Äúone social media post per month‚Äù quota for a local doula group I‚Äôm in. A midwife dm‚Äôd me, disagreeing with a claim I made about newborn discomfort in the birth canal. I‚Äôd read about this fact before and it was even brought up in my initial doula training. I was sure I was correct, yet I was sent into one of the worst spirals of self-hatred of my life. I‚Äôd never felt so incompetent. My thoughts had never been scarier. I was convinced that everyone I had status with had seen the post and disagreed with it and I was now the laughing stalk of the area. I then pinned this idea to the itinerary of an upcoming meeting with my doula group, and I was convinced one of the topics was added because of my post. I emailed the leader of the group (actually it turns out I emailed THE ENTIRE BOARD) with a panicked message about how sorry I was. She had no idea what I was talking about and I completely humiliated myself as a new, inexperienced member.

Just today, I received a text from a client saying she was checking into an appointment with her midwife that I had agreed to attend. I‚Äôd forgotten to put it on my calendar, and I was currently tied up with one of my 3 other jobs, which was nannying my infant nieces. I had to explain the situation and apologize profusely and I could tell she wasn‚Äôt impressed. I‚Äôve been thrown between beating myself up and distracting myself all day.

Somehow, every time I move forward, I feel like absolute shit. Every time I make a mistake I feel like absolute shit. Every single thing I do makes me want to give it all up because I can never ever be good enough. People tell me I‚Äôm born for this field and it‚Äôs my calling. This is genuinely my dream career and I want to believe them. Everyone says that every doula is important because we all offer different skills and personality traits. I want to know I‚Äôm not just the one exception to that. I‚Äôm working my ass off and pouring so much time and money into getting my life started, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm good enough. I hate this feeling so much. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and confidently learn from my mistakes, but both just make me hate myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been in therapy and I‚Äôve done all the natural mental health support I can do and nothings changing. I‚Äôm terrified for when I actually support my first birth (I‚Äôve attended two as a shadow to an experienced doula but never been the primary.)

2506,"I think I'm a fairly intelligent person, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists for over 30 years, but somehow until recently I hadn't heard the term ""imposter syndrome"". My entire life I would wait until someone became a really close friend and I would confess to them that I'm racked with these irrational fears of everyone finding out that I'm a fraud and completely unqualified to be who i am and because of these fears I tend to live my life in a cycle of creating perfection in my career, family, home, wardrobe, parenting, etc and then reaching some undefined peak, only to watch myself burn it all the ground. I've rebuilt my entire life so many times that I can't even count anymore. Now I've actually created my own company, surrounded myself in great people that all seem to think I'm some kind of genius, of which I am not, become financially successful (at least to some degree), kids are grown, marriage is stable, mental health is under control, and I've actually stuck with my current career for 10+ years. My work actually brings me joy. It also brings stress, bc it's work, but there is joy. But I'm also finding out that these feelings and fears I have are an actual thing with a name. At first that made me feel validated. I'm so glad that this sub exists and that the people here seem nice and supportive of each other. It's reassuring. It's also terrifying to know for sure that this isn't all in my head and I may be doomed to repeat this destructive cycle forever. I'm getting older. I can't keep destroying everything and rebuilding. I'm getting too old for it. Everyone understood when I was 20, a new parent, still finding myself. I know the fears are still there. I'm still terrified that I'm a complete fraud. I know that someday, any day now, people will realize that I never knew anything or even knew what I was doing as I trained others. Then those other people that I trained will have to explain themselves too. I know it's irrational, but I also know all too well how this story ends. I've been here many times before. Idk.

2509,"I'm a wedding photographer in the UK and have done it since around 2014. I started by doing a few friends weddings and it grew from there to where I now have almost 50 weddings a year.  

I used to really enjoy the job and my work but the more I do it, the faker I feel and the more I worry. I feel that I've marketed myself really well rather than people booking me for my work itself. I feel that I have a fairly realistic idea of how good I am at wedding photography and while I wouldn't put myself at the very bottom, I know I have a long way to go before I would ever like my own work.   

A couple who live in Canada found my Instagram and have booked me for their wedding in France which is happening in a weeks time. I have never felt more like a fraud in my entire life. The pressure is huge. They are paying me to go to France to take their wedding photos. This is now no longer that I just happen to be a local wedding photographer who knows a local venue well.... this is now a case where someone has found me and could have picked anyone in the entire UK or most of Europe! Why me? My work really isn't that good! It's average at best. I rarely even post on Instagram so I don't even know how they came across my page.   

The pressure of photographing their wedding and delivering their images is now weighing so heavy on my shoulders. I'm already going through a mental battle right now with medical testing for what could be a serious life-threatening disease. The added pressure of now having to go to France next week to photograph a wedding is huge.    

I don't even get much feedback from couples anymore either. I used to send off the photos and they would email me back telling me how much they love their photos and then would write a review. I've not had that much recently. I send the photos off and hear absolutely nothing from them ever again. So naturally I ruminate and think that they dislike their images. I keep wondering if I'm doing something different than I used to or if I've become complacent but I'm not so sure. I put in so much effort on my wedding days.  

I don't know. I just have no confidence at all at the moment and the lack of that and feedback makes me want to quit.... but what other job could I do to earn this sort of money and only work 1 day a week??

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I‚Äôve done good. I‚Äôve made mistakes, gotten subpar marks like everyone else but I was almost always able to pull it together when it mattered - GCSEs, A Levels, uni exams and assignments. This last year, the last year of my Bachelor‚Äôs, I seemed to be on track for a First, with me pulling myself through assignments with First-class marks.

And then I didn‚Äôt do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master‚Äôs program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It‚Äôs always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

Now I‚Äôm looking back on everything I‚Äôve done well and it feels like a fluke, a fraud, that I was just lucky and wasn‚Äôt really worthy of the good marks and grades given to me. I‚Äôve always been able to pull it together when it mattered but this is when it mattered the most and I didn‚Äôt do good enough.

People are saying that a 2:1 Bachelor‚Äôs is still good enough but I can‚Äôt say how much shame I‚Äôve felt around it. Given my way I WOULDN‚ÄôT be graduating right now - do you know how shit it feels to have graduation feel like a mark of shame rather than merit?!",understanding imposter syndrome pretty limited ‚Äô pretty sure ‚Äô developed Throughout academic career school uni ‚Äô done good ‚Äô made mistake gotten subpar mark like everyone else almost always able pull together mattered GCSEs Levels uni exam assignment last year last year Bachelor ‚Äô seemed track First pulling assignment Firstclass mark ‚Äô good enough project progress undergraduate Master ‚Äô program poor habit procrastinating shit cramming way last couple week come side good mark ‚Äô always worked well real reason stop guess thought could nope ‚Äô looking back everything ‚Äô done well feel like fluke fraud lucky ‚Äô really worthy good mark grade given ‚Äô always able pull together mattered mattered ‚Äô good enough People saying 21 Bachelor ‚Äô still good enough ‚Äô say much shame ‚Äô felt around Given way ‚Äô graduating right know shit feel graduation feel like mark shame rather merit,trust

2525,"Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this forum. I basically wanted to vent some stuff I've had on my mind the past weekend. So, I graduated recently with my bachelor's in statistics in early May, and I have been job hunting since then until literally a few days ago. I managed to finally get what I would have considered my ""dream job"", a data analyst position at a big company with great benefits and a fantastic starting salary. I truly couldn't believe it when I got the call back that I had finally gotten the job offer after having interviewed countless times and even being rejected once from another company I really wanted to work with.

Now, I struggle with incredibly low self-esteem in general. Although I graduated with the top of my class and had a near 4.0 grade point average, I still considered myself less than adequate for one reason: I had very little relevant work experience. I knew some programming languages sure as was required by my school coursework, but because I was a commuter student I wasn't involved in any fancy professional clubs/orgs, I had no internships in the field to speak of, and when I originally graduated, I was terrified I'd end up in a terrible job I didn't want doing something I was going to be bad at because all I really know how to do was study hard, learn really hard math, and get good grades.

I was and still am shocked as hell I managed to actually get my foot in the door as an official business analyst doing what I had originally went to college to do. But I feel like that initial anxiety I had still hasn't gone away. Now, I'm worried about basically ""fucking it up"". I didn't lie to them about knowing technologies I didn't know, it was obvious from my resume and the stories I chose to tell to them during my interviews that I had no internship experience and was basically a brand new freshie.

I basically just tried to convince them that I knew how to analyze datasets and math and could communicate difficult concepts to people. Which, honestly, I believe I can do. But at the same time, I'm not an expert by any means in any of the softwares I have used. In college, when given the choice to do something with software or by hand, I almost always did it by hand because I just preferred that, and I learned better doing that.

So I guess basically I'm wondering if what I'm going through is the dreaded imposter syndrome I've always heard about in fields such as these. I always felt deep down that I wasn't good enough, and I was shocked anyone decided to give me a chance at all. Part of me wants to tell myself that if they thought I wasn't going to be able to do the job, they wouldn't have hired me. I was a first-generation college student, no one has ever done a job like I'm doing in my family, and I literally have no frame of reference. I feel like I'm in undiscovered territory, and I have no idea what my first day is going to be like and what my manager is going to expect from me for the first few weeks. I just don't want to let anybody down, and I want to be what I have to be. What should I do?",Hi first time Ive posted forum basically wanted vent stuff Ive mind past weekend graduated recently bachelor statistic early May job hunting since literally day ago managed finally get would considered dream job data analyst position big company great benefit fantastic starting salary truly couldnt believe got call back finally gotten job offer interviewed countless time even rejected another company really wanted work struggle incredibly low selfesteem general Although graduated top class near 40 grade point average still considered le adequate one reason little relevant work experience knew programming language sure required school coursework commuter student wasnt involved fancy professional clubsorgs internship field speak originally graduated terrified Id end terrible job didnt want something going bad really know study hard learn really hard math get good grade still shocked hell managed actually get foot door official business analyst originally went college feel like initial anxiety still hasnt gone away Im worried basically fucking didnt lie knowing technology didnt know obvious resume story chose tell interview internship experience basically brand new freshie basically tried convince knew analyze datasets math could communicate difficult concept people honestly believe time Im expert mean software used college given choice something software hand almost always hand preferred learned better guess basically Im wondering Im going dreaded imposter syndrome Ive always heard field always felt deep wasnt good enough shocked anyone decided give chance Part want tell thought wasnt going able job wouldnt hired firstgeneration college student one ever done job like Im family literally frame reference feel like Im undiscovered territory idea first day going like manager going expect first week dont want let anybody want,trust

2532,"I battled a brain tumor called a vestibular schwannoma all of last year. It hurt. I was in so much pain, feeling so dizzy like a mix of a bad hangover and the stomach virus. I'd feel intensely weak, confused, and haunted by a vicious ringing in my ear. It was like hearing a bagpipe or teakettle going off in my ears 24/7, while the other symptoms happened EVERYDAY for hours on end, to barying degrees. The vertigo was also terrible. Sometimes I'd fall over. Sometimes I'd have a panic attack while going through it. Sometimes it'd last for hours. It would even keep me from sleeping. Then there are the dangerous situations I was put in because of the loss of balance and loss of hearing 

Due to the COVID pandemic, it was t easy to seek professional medical care. Doctors would make me wait months or even into the next year which I outright refused. I took my own data on my symptoms, my medication, my food, ans the time of day these symptoms happened, all to give insight and remove any extraneous variables as to what was happening. The ER doctors couldnt help me as they didn't find a brain tumor on the CT scan. It wasn't until I got an MRI two months later while going through all of this, that the WNT diagnosed the brain tumor. Not to mention the severe hearing loss in both ears, especially the left.

I saw the best in others and I saw the worst. My mental health suffered while waiting for care. And worst of all the doctors were somewhat dismissive of my needs. It wasn't until I saw a doctor at Duke University Medical Center, one of the most advanced medical centers in the world for skull base tumors, even able to perform operations no other medical center can, that I got real help.

A Vestibular Achwannoma has a high survival rate. Mine wasn't that big at 7mm ans some survive even larger. 

I talk a lot about it on my GoFundMe my friends made, where I post updates and on social media as well.

And yet, a part of me feels like maybe it wasn't that bad. I didn't die. I didn't end up like the others who are worse off than I am today. I felt I was dying and was even suicidal, thinking and plotting ways to off myself that would be considered an accident. I didn't want to live life with the amount of hearing loss I had, the potential for permanent dizziness, ans these tormenting symptoms to continue even after surgery (which the symptoms have since resolved sans the hearing loss).

Maybe I'm a whiner. Maybe I'm not simply updating friends and gsmiyl, but looking for attention. Maybe I shouldn't have spent my GoFundMe donations on more than just medical bills - like a dietician, additional physical therapy, and yoga lessons. All were to help me adjust to life after a brain tumor and improve my almost non-existent balance. But it wasn't specifically necessary, even if it worked.

I know what I went through was real, and nobody else's opinion on the matter has any meaning but mine. Even now, I still talk to a therapist who I've seem throughout this process. She says this is normal for many, these feelings. What I went through was real. Did someone doubt me? Yep, but nobody else sided with those people.

And yet, I sometimes wonder of the worst days of my life were really pain, agony, and loss, or simply exaggerating for help.",battled brain tumor called vestibular schwannoma last year hurt much pain feeling dizzy like mix bad hangover stomach virus Id feel intensely weak confused haunted vicious ringing ear like hearing bagpipe teakettle going ear 247 symptom happened EVERYDAY hour end barying degree vertigo also terrible Sometimes Id fall Sometimes Id panic attack going Sometimes itd last hour would even keep sleeping dangerous situation put loss balance loss hearing Due COVID pandemic easy seek professional medical care Doctors would make wait month even next year outright refused took data symptom medication food an time day symptom happened give insight remove extraneous variable happening ER doctor couldnt help didnt find brain tumor CT scan wasnt got MRI two month later going WNT diagnosed brain tumor mention severe hearing loss ear especially left saw best others saw worst mental health suffered waiting care worst doctor somewhat dismissive need wasnt saw doctor Duke University Medical Center one advanced medical center world skull base tumor even able perform operation medical center got real help Vestibular Achwannoma high survival rate Mine wasnt big 7mm an survive even larger talk lot GoFundMe friend made post update social medium well yet part feel like maybe wasnt bad didnt die didnt end like others worse today felt dying even suicidal thinking plotting way would considered accident didnt want live life amount hearing loss potential permanent dizziness an tormenting symptom continue even surgery symptom since resolved sans hearing loss Maybe Im whiner Maybe Im simply updating friend gsmiyl looking attention Maybe shouldnt spent GoFundMe donation medical bill like dietician additional physical therapy yoga lesson help adjust life brain tumor improve almost nonexistent balance wasnt specifically necessary even worked know went real nobody el opinion matter meaning mine Even still talk therapist Ive seem throughout process say normal many feeling went real someone doubt Yep nobody else sided people yet sometimes wonder worst day life really pain agony loss simply exaggerating help,fear
2533,"Not sure if this fits in this subreddit, but here we go lol. Short version: I am lazy by nature. However, in February I decided to start working 2 jobs and pay down a bunch of my student loan debt. I also got a job I really enjoy and may have finally found my career path. Because I'm currently so active, every new person I meet thinks I'm some sort of go-getter. 

Long version: I consider myself quite a lazy person because outside of work and exercising a bit, I mainly spend my time playing video games. I'm very introverted, so I don't go out much and meet new people very often, but I have been on a couple of online dating apps, which is where this fa√ßade started. I bring up working 2 jobs and I even take a course my current company is paying for, and everyone is really impressed not even on just the apps, but at work too. 

Without going too much into detail, I graduated university about 6 years ago, and for 5 years, I was in a very deep cycle of depression. I moved in with my mother after a big lay off and I was only paying on the interest of a few private student loans, not even making a dent in the principle balance. Late last year though, I decided enough would be enough, and earlier this year I started working a 2nd job and am able to use the money for my student loans. I got a new main job in January and the company is paying for a course for me to take to advance my career, so I'm also taking that. So yes, it seems like I'm active, and in fact I am no longer depressed at all, but I'm only active now to make up for the last 5 years of being a lazy bastard. And honestly, I'm probably going to go back to being lazy once all of my debt is done with and my course is over. 

So yeah, I just feel like a lazy slob at heart, but everyone thinks I'm this go-getter because of all this stuff I'm doing temporarily.",sure fit subreddit go lol Short version lazy nature However February decided start working 2 job pay bunch student loan debt also got job really enjoy may finally found career path Im currently active every new person meet think Im sort gogetter Long version consider quite lazy person outside work exercising bit mainly spend time playing video game Im introverted dont go much meet new people often couple online dating apps fa√ßade started bring working 2 job even take course current company paying everyone really impressed even apps work Without going much detail graduated university 6 year ago 5 year deep cycle depression moved mother big lay paying interest private student loan even making dent principle balance Late last year though decided enough would enough earlier year started working 2nd job able use money student loan got new main job January company paying course take advance career Im also taking yes seems like Im active fact longer depressed Im active make last 5 year lazy bastard honestly Im probably going go back lazy debt done course yeah feel like lazy slob heart everyone think Im gogetter stuff Im temporarily,anticipation

2537,"So last week I was losing my mind.  I've been negotiating with this potential vendor, and we had a meeting and afterward I didn't hear from them for a few days.  So I'm like, 'look how much of a fuckup I am, that I can't even entice vendors', I was convinced that I'd sounded like an asshat, not knowing what I was talking about.  At the same time, I got pissy with a customer because they were asking about a bunch of asinine stuff, so then I spent two days convinced I was going to get fired for pissing off a customer.  And add to it, my mentor asked how I was doing, and I wrote back this 'fear of failure' thing, and then didn't hear back from him...

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.  And my mentor made this long apology about how he should be doing better by me if I feel like a failure, that he loves working with me, etc.

It's all just so tough to believe sometimes...  I'm totally convinced I should be a janitor, that I'm not worth a damn to this company I've been a manager at for nearly twenty years.

I was fresh out of high school, confident, and ready for challenges that came. I took some courses and found out I was pregnant with my ‚Äúhigh school sweetheart.‚Äù That put college on pause. Fast forward, after he had cheated on me again we ended up getting divorced, two kids deep.

I remember him saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised your waist is that skinny.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour ankles are kind of fat.‚Äù It was like a load of bricks hit me. Why say that? Why point that out? He was no supermodel and of course I wasn‚Äôt scrutinizing his appearance. I just wanted a loving relationship. Fast fast forward. The scrutiny turned into much more. Making fun of me in front of his friends for laughs, hitting in my friends, being angry at me for not indulging him in a threesome, saying it was unfair and that I was effecting his life in an unfair way by withholding. Telling my I was stupid. I was back in college. I graduated with honors and kids in tow. Everything I did I now found myself checking three times to be sure.  Because now I‚Äôm convinced to a T that I am no good. I was nominated for two awards by my instructors.

I was in a really competitive high school a few years back, and actually managed to get great grades but was seen as the ‚Äúsmart kid‚Äù and my friends and teachers judged me a lot if I wasn‚Äôt getting into a prestigious program or school or if I did less well on tests which we had every week, and my mental health was really bad as a result. A lot of my friends had really toxic or abusive relationships (platonic romantic familial) and always leveraged off success as their defining ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing better‚Äù kind of moment, and it compelled me to do the same even though it was destroying me. Fast forward and I‚Äôve graduated a long time ago and no longer talk to anyone there. 

I‚Äôve noticed that my imposter syndrome has gotten so bad and ironically manifests in little white lies. For example, I‚Äôve been telling people that I got into X university when they ask but decided not to go; but the truth is I didn‚Äôt even apply there. I hate how easily little lies like this slip out of my mouth even when meeting new people when they ask, and I really want to stop even though these lies have no effect on serious aspects of my life :( yesterday I met someone new and this slipped out yet again, and it just bothers me so much. 

I go to a great college now that I worked my ass off to get into, but I feel like a Personality Imposter if that makes sense, and I‚Äôm surrounded by all these super talented people who are really passionate and collaborative and the brightest people in their countries etc. it really sucks that I simultaneously want to celebrate my successes which I know are valid but it feels like my whole life they were nothing compared to others.

I believe this to be very true and I can back it up with evidence throughout the most recent years of my life in specific.

2563,"Hi community. My first post in this community and I am curious about how Imposter Syndrome shows not only in your life but also specifically in relationships. 

About me: I am 37, almost 38, first and foremost a musician who has struggled with performance anxiety and always trying to give my best but then always end up thinking it wasn‚Äôt good enough, or that there‚Äôs someone better than me. Add in having parents who constantly asked why I wasn‚Äôt doing well in college and subsequently thinking they are always judging my every move in life. 

But I think most notably I struggle with my Imposter Syndrome surfacing in my relationships. I am gay and have had a couple significant relationships in my life, my last one being 7 years with someone who I viewed as more successful than me, smarter, etc. I am now entering a new relationship with a very creative person (who has admitted his own struggles with Imposter) but who has that ability to be confident, and show his self so strongly. As this relationship is going I find myself thinking thoughts that tear down every facet of hope in this relationship. And I am madly and deeply in love more and more every day.  Like, ‚Äúwhat does this guy want with you, you don‚Äôt talk strong like he does, you don‚Äôt have strong opinions, you‚Äôre not good enough for him, if he really gets to know you he won‚Äôt like you, one day he will meet someone else that is better than you‚Äù

Even though I know that I suffer from imposter syndrome, (I'm in therapy for this and other reasons), I TRUELY believe that what I'm doing is bad and that I am stupid. People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

Update: I handed it in last week!! The only thought that kept me going was ""It doesn't matter if it's bad. Just finish it somehow."" I couldn't convince myself that what I doing was good. But telling myself that it didn't matter and not to care worked to some extend. All that matters is to hand it in. Even if you think it's bad.

2577,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I‚Äôm in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

‚ÄúYou went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won‚Äôt make enough because of it to make that ok‚Äù

‚ÄúYour almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??‚Äù

It‚Äôs the answer to the last one that makes me realize I‚Äôve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I‚Äôve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I‚Äôm a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn‚Äôt know I just couldn‚Äôt hack it academically, even though I‚Äôve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn‚Äôt worked, it‚Äôs because those around me wouldn‚Äôt let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fianc√© before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù and snap everyone around me out of it.

2578,"I have been a programmer for a while. I wanted change my specialisation as what I am currently doing doesn't interest me anymore. Work wise I have been doing ok, completing tasks on time but nothing groundbreaking. Just regular work. I recently got admitted to a masters program (still waiting for others results). I also got my first ever academic rejection letter. Now I think about how I will perform in the above mentioned program. It is fairly obvious, that the people who will be attending the college are fairly bright and at least as smart as I am with chances being multiple times brighter and more better.

2583,"In finite games (or games where there is a goal, a winner and a loser, and set boundaries), the prize is a title (whether that is being a gold medalist, getting a promotion, or being a degree holder). This is in contrast of infinite games, where there are no winners, and the point of the game is to keep the game going (for example, the game of literature, the game of science, and the game of music). 

Imposter Syndrome typically occurs to me, and maybe some of you, in school or at work (both in which are finite games). The titles that we earn in finite games are titles symbolizing the accomplishments of the past. Having a Harvard degree symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Becoming a director symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Getting a gold medal symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. These titles are not about the present, but the past! These titles are a form of credit that tells the world that we did well in the past; the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Possibly, anxiety from Imposter Syndrome comes from having the titles but being unsure about our capacity to hold up to the expectations of these titles.

How does one hold up to the expectations of these titles? One possibility is to do well enough... in which you later get another title. And then the cycle repeats itself. You can have your high school degree, your bachelors, your masters, and you can be part of the C-suite, and still have Imposter Syndrome. 

My proposed solution, and I know it's easier said than done, is to let go of the expectations and trust that we've been appropriately given the title. There is no way that *all* these people, institutions, and systems were wrong. Since part of the anxiety is not meeting expectations, another thing that can be done is focusing on the present and do the best we can - the chances are that we can meet expectations. After all, it's a game and we've been beating level after level - we're literally where we are supposed to be.",finite game game goal winner loser set boundary prize title whether gold medalist getting promotion degree holder contrast infinite game winner point game keep game going example game literature game science game music Imposter Syndrome typically occurs maybe school work finite game title earn finite game title symbolizing accomplishment past Harvard degree symbolizes well enough past Becoming director symbolizes well enough past Getting gold medal symbolizes well enough past title present past title form credit tell world well past best predictor future behavior past behavior Possibly anxiety Imposter Syndrome come title unsure capacity hold expectation title one hold expectation title One possibility well enough later get another title cycle repeat high school degree bachelor master part Csuite still Imposter Syndrome proposed solution know easier said done let go expectation trust weve appropriately given title way people institution system wrong Since part anxiety meeting expectation another thing done focusing present best chance meet expectation game weve beating level level literally supposed,trust

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

¬∑ Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‚ÄòBecause I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others‚Äô or ‚ÄòI choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other‚Äôs accomplishments‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards‚Äô. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as ‚Äì by its very nature ‚Äì it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‚Äòus‚Äô and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",think ‚Äô belong think ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô fraud getting idea station ‚Äô worthy really Sound familiar Welcome Imposter Syndrome ‚Äô good company Nigella Lawson Michelle Obama Lady GaGa Lily Allen shared imposter syndrome experience publicly demon ‚Äô umbrella term life one limiting belief generalised one may accompanied specific belief typically formed rationally childhood child may serve u well example ¬∑ need everyone approve ¬∑ valued must succeed everything ¬∑ OK make mistake bad ¬∑ feel happy life without contributing back way ¬∑ Everyone need rely someone stronger ¬∑ ‚Äô feel sadness discomfort pain ¬∑ Someone somewhere take responsibility would list look like However time move thing change become adult childhood belief serve u le well ‚Äì resultant behaviour may incongruent situation lead conclusion one thing mean grow develop childhood belief adopt new set belief serve u better adult progression follows broad pattern developing dependence child independence young adult interdependence mature adult overall set belief developing time However u carry childhood belief u adulthood innocuous time sometimes impede performance high functioning interdependent adult adult benefit identifying limiting belief growing valuable belief way example common limiting belief sitting Imposter Syndrome umbrella ‚Äò must compare others ‚Äô reframed ‚Äò live life term ‚Äô ‚Äò unique set character strength others ‚Äô turn reframed belief underpin valuable affirmation ‚Äò live life enjoy success others ‚Äô ‚Äò choose celebrate success without reference ‚Äô accomplishment ‚Äô ‚Äò fact choose live life authentically mean compare standard ‚Äô standard element working PERMA hypnotherapy developing high degree selfawareness via exploring character strength value belief limiting belief pave way defining identity turn leaf ideally placed choose best future Working hypnotherapist particularly well suited personal development area ‚Äì nature ‚Äì open pathway part know recognise ‚Äò u ‚Äô deeper level wisdom ideal need take big step forward,trust

2599,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don‚Äôt know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I‚Äôm so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my ‚Äúthing‚Äù, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can‚Äôt you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your ‚Äúthing‚Äù?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I‚Äôm not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I‚Äôm saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can‚Äôt I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I‚Äôm a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking. I feel like I am just not the type to succeed. And so I‚Äôve decided that I want to start investigating instead of feeling this pressure in my chest and trying to logically calm myself.

2601,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.

2605,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

2606,"I'm (26F) starting my very first official job as an engineering consultant for a manufacturing plant next week. I'm so scared I'm going to mess up production or that I'm not going to have enough ideas for my boss's liking. Essentially they want me to come in and improve little things like worker safety measures and production output. I have my Master's in industrial engineering but I have no clue how to put any of my textbooks to use. Feeling so confused on what to do, and I shouldn't be at all. 

I have to do research on a type of manufacturing process for this as well, because my boss is trusting me to understand how it works. I've just been at home playing Minecraft instead. It's like I *want* to show up unprepared, and the more I think about doing the research, the less I'm able to get done and the more angry I am with myself.

I'll even throw in the anxiety I have about getting there on time. Call time is 6 am, and I live an hour away with my mom.

2607,"Something shifted in my job recently. It didn't come with a title change, or a promotion, it just sort of happened. Suddenly I'm supposed to be making policies, procedures, and ""roll outs"". I've never done that in my life. I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing. I don't even know where to start. My manager looks at me like I'm a moron and says ""all you have to do is pick a date and determine exactly how we're going to do this"". Is that supposed to be simple? It doesn't sound simple. Was there some sort of class on this that I missed? 

I get told to look after my mental health and prioritize my work. However, when I tried doing that I was very publicly chewed out over something that, in my mind, is such a low priority item that it doesn't make sense to stress about it. Every time I make those sorts of calls, I get ripped a new asshole. Honestly I feel like some fucked up weirdo because I don't think the same, or communicate the same way as the rest of them. 

Often times what I say is misunderstood even though I think I'm being perfectly clear. I'm ridiculously insecure about how I speak and write because people don't seem to understand me. It's gotten to the point where I sometimes have other people (outside of work) read over what I'm going to say because I'm not confident that I can express myself in a way that my coworkers will understand. It's not an actual language barrier. We're all native English speakers, but sometimes it really doesn't feel that way.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university. The stuff with new guidelines but no updates and whenever I get an update email I tell myself I'll read it later but never do it.

2621,"# Setting

I work in academia, and I'm well familiar with people who are struggling with impostor syndrome.

My personal impression is that the most common type around me is women who feel like they never work enough and then overwork themselves and become bitter and serious. It's a serious condition.

# My problem

**However**, lately I'm thinking if imposter syndrome is actually my problem.

My issue is, on the surface, *the opposite*. I find it hard to do any work at all. As soon as I face the smallest wall that I have to jump over (metaphorically speaking), I won't do any more work that day.

I find it hard doing even a half hour of work a day. Or finish anything else in my life.

Any experiences with that? Any solutions?",Setting work academia Im well familiar people struggling impostor syndrome personal impression common type around woman feel like never work enough overwork become bitter serious serious condition problem However lately Im thinking imposter syndrome actually problem issue surface opposite find hard work soon face smallest wall jump metaphorically speaking wont work day find hard even half hour work day finish anything else life experience solution,fear

I have been a volunteer firefighter for about 2 years and I feel like an imposter. I completed my 36 hour class over a year ago and am trying to further my education but I work full time and havent found a good class for my 240. It was a dream come true when an officer who had heard from a mutual person that  I've always wanted to save lives knocked on my door and asked me to join his department. I missed calls in the beginning because my fear of failure (which has turned into a self fulfilling prophecy) told me I couldnt handle it. The day I joined was the happiest day of my life! I lack confidence, get tunnel vision on even the smallest fire call. Other calls i missed because my work schedule. Drills arent as in depth as i need and the longer I'm here the more I feel like it's too late to jump in and go. These guys say I'll learn on calls but I always look like a dumbass. As a young woman with no experience and hardly any training I just feel like a fake. I feel like these guys see me as a joke and already know I dont belong there. I feel like I'm wearing a halloween costume, lack confidence to speak with other ems personnel or victims. I want it so bad!

Now, by working remotely, conversations with other co-workers are not so frequent and that makes me think everybody is working harder than I am. 

I also had this feeling that my supervisors are constantly looking at the chat to spot if I am online or not and whenever I did a break, I felt guilty and I tried to be back at work as soon as possible because my brain kept telling me ""Your boss probably has already called several times and you are here....having lunch.....pffff, you really do not deserve this job"". 

Well, once I started to ignore these thoughts and take my time to have lunch or to have a conversation with my family, I felt much better.

2658,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you‚Äôre succeeding, even if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the skills,‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You‚Äôre succeeding. It‚Äôs the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that‚Äôs who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It‚Äôs hard to tell internally whether you‚Äôre funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You‚Äôre not a good judge of that. You‚Äôre on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people‚Äôs actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it‚Äôs so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn‚Äôt be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There‚Äôs no downside. Even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it or supposedly don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you‚Äôll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don‚Äôt know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I‚Äôll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I‚Äôve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I‚Äôve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there‚Äôs a more tangible motivator- ‚ÄòI really want to have a good day, and it‚Äôs statistically much more likely if I‚Äôm productive.‚Äô Try it if you‚Äôd like. Idk. I didn‚Äôt keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain‚Äôt real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it‚Äôs happening, that‚Äôs a fantastic help. It‚Äôs even better when/if you‚Äôre able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I‚Äôm rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you‚Äôll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful.  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£

2659,"Hi All,

Let me start by saying I believe I've had imposter syndrome for as long as I can remember (going back to elementary school and believing I was not at the same level as my school peers).

&#x200B;

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job. I've been working on my resume (obsessing mostly), trying to perfect it, sell myself as best I can without over-selling. My father says I need to just start applying but I am just so anxious that any job I get with some responsibility, I'll end up failing.

&#x200B;

I do suffer from anxiety and OCD, so I'm basically always already doubting myself. The thing is, through experience, I tend to overthink situations. I have for as long as I can remember. But in the end, things that I've overthought tend to not be as scary as I've made them in my mind.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

2663,"Hello. I am currently finishing my last semester of undergrad and I just got an acceptance letter to theoretically the best possible Graduate Program for what I would like to study in BMS. But, I do not deserve any of this.
I have a pretty high GPA from having easy teachers and being able to pay my way through assignments, as well as cheating on tests. Obviously, you have to do some type of research in order to get into a research-based Ph.D. program- which I did (kinda?). I've only ever been in one lab and while its cool, I severely overexaggerated the quantity as well as the quality of work that was being done in that one lab that I chilled in for a couple of months. My lab advisor is pretty cool and wrote me an amazing letter of recommendation.

2664,"Hello all:

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others. I have hesitated to share my thoughts here for fear of being insensitive to others that need more assistance. I appologize in advance if I offend anyone, know that I didnt have malicious intentions. A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

I would appreciate any perspectives. Even critical negitive ones will help me see if my problem is important or not, even though I understand it is something many go through.

Once again, I hope I haven't offended anyone, I promise I had no ill intentions.",Hello would like thank anyone reading taking time life read stranger thought starting high school soon understand age problem like common trying find outward perspective others hesitated share thought fear insensitive others need assistance appologize advance offend anyone know didnt malicious intention disclaimer first paragraph may sound little arrogant said feel dont deserve life grown fortunate area many student highly academic Personally others see pretty good light someone model student good aconplishments However year go feel like dont deserve life didnt work hard ebough thing done see others working hard feel level Yet part preventing motivated work would appreciate perspective Even critical negitive one help see problem important even though understand something many go hope havent offended anyone promise ill intention,trust
2666,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",Hello first post Im wondering belongs Going back rough childhood always felt like havent really anything get lot youth Ive felt like didnt really anything belong worked moving past However barely adult 18 started journey feel day faking dont belong started work chain coffee shop ended dating one coworkers dating ended quitting started work food truck odds end able get shift working job brake good term stood friend continued help already met family still really good term well went different direction completely changed life dont want give many detail privacy reason basically Grandma working contractor client needed full time accountant daughter also worked client full time employee two running basically financial aspect swamped needed help Im fresh high school working first semester college reach guess GM started accounting really young dad taught daughter around 15 ish GM knew client wanted someone experience help didnt want pay said experience GM also bad experience college grad thought knew everything didnt listen direction GM interviewed basically said look saw work EXBF know hard worker opportunity pretend experience highschool etc would teach everything needed know True word GM amazing taught almost everything know amazing human helped treated like family entire time Unfortunately client wasnt best left GM actually vouched going back Highschool taught worked 2 different position accounting paper experience real life experience give take year 18 Ive field year found lot people field havent gone school life experience thing going back first extended offer long even opportunity felt wrong Like lying amazing family accepting didnt feel right reason Im forever grateful still contact haunted somehow lied cheated way life got accepted first lease boyfriend got key last week Im paying car able buy feel way range two pet pretty good place would like think feel wrong like didnt anything get Like someone going figure lied get dont know Im Im fake took job people work get,trust

2668,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them. Sorry this is so long, most of you probably won't even get to the end but my point is: is the way I felt about being called a hero imposter syndrome?",context used house directly across street workplace work gas station old man lived sister would regularly come store help couple minor chore like taking trash really enjoyed helping think needed thing occupy time gave much free food drink wanted basically sweet old man store street corner house street corner right across u really shitty intersection people often run red light cut parking lot going way fast old man fruit stand front portion house porch would hit car time year one night month ago dude crashed directly house old man bedroom thankfully wasnt part way living room shattered main support beam house inside time coworker heard loud crash went outside see happened saw truck started freaking rushed see old man ok dug rubble trying get old man passed truck ended unburying driver door couldnt get farther checked dude hurt said shoulder hurt lot bleeding conscious seemed pain mostly ok left paramedic look arrived went around side truck find way heard old man calling broke door probably shouldnt house wasnt exactly stable started calling name could find wasnt buried whole lot debris couple wall worth stuff completely hidden view use voice find exactly uncover pull Later night coworker called hero next day another coworker thing next day also reporter going interviewing old man wanted know got assume interview well tried point shook head said wasnt turned walked away made extremely uncomfortable especially people calling hero face wasnt feeling modesty like oh anyone would would call positive emotion Like thank nice Im hero like aversion called negative emotion like absolutely dont call dont deserve called havent told anyone wife people store coworkers regular customer know people talk rural community didnt tell Sorry long probably wont even get end point way felt called hero imposter syndrome,anticipation

2673,"So my fianc√© is probably one of the hardest workers I‚Äôve ever seen. She has been promoted multiple times, recognized by higher-ups, complements galore, etc., yet she still doubts herself. Heavily...

The most recent example was that her company laid off her entire team (8 people), but kept her because, well...she‚Äôs awesome! This morning she was telling me that she‚Äôs basically not good enough for this role among other thing. She was also perturbed that some of the district managers that she worked with previously have not wished her good luck with the new role. And it irritates her.This was after many, many, other people complimenting/congratulating her.

She is finally seeing a therapist and her therapist diagnosed her with IS. I am diagnosed OCD and I know I do things that annoy her, but she does whatever she can to help me, so how can I help her? 

I get so frustrated that she‚Äôs verbally harming herself when it comes to her job and other things she does (like decorating the house). I tell her genuinely that I think she is amazing and I just kind of get to a boiling point where I don‚Äôt know what to do and we start arguing. Please help!

Still, during my masters thesis I had quite the problem with anxiety -- I felt like I am basically stealing my supervisors time (a feeling, which I yet admittedly did not fully shake). No I am thinking about applying to postdocs and I feel really anxious particularly about asking for references. Like what if my former supervisors my think it me a leech? Also I am very unsure about the whole postdoc business.  


Is there a way to shake these feelings? Currently, friends and colleagues think I am ok (my advisor is actually quite positive, which makes me quite distrustful). On the other hand, it is easy to find CVs in the internet that make mine pale in comparison. Now, I know that these are biased by the way I find the CVs (basically by looking up the authors of papers I like). For me the question is, whether there is a way to estimate my own worth.

2704,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling with intrusive and negative thought about myself for more than 4 years now and I just can‚Äôt deal with it no more. I want to reduce my symptoms but I have yet failed to do so. There is a naut in my reasoning and I need to undo but I need help.

So I consider myself pretty lucky. I have good parents, I have always done good at school during childhood. I guess I always had an underlying anxiety issue because at age 15, I could bare a break up and tried (unsuccessfully-thanks lord) to end my life. This depressive period change something in me because I started to put way more importance and attention to my grades. In college, I was often 20% above average in my class, gpa (R score) way above the mean. Yet, I always aimed to get higher, never satisfied. Always giving more than requested in evaluations, making myself almost on the verge of burn out but the adrenaline kept pushing me. In my music recital, I would cry or get mad after my performance because I made mistakes I didn‚Äôt do when rehearsing, my music teacher feeling bad for me. When I did good, I always felt awkward, putting it on chance, trying to hide/deviate the conversation.

Then last year, I got in the undergraduate program I wanted (cognitive neuroscience) and everything got worst. I‚Äôm (now doubting) aiming to enter a PhD program, so does the majority of my 500 classmates, but only 12 places are available. The teachers had to put fire under our ass : ‚Äúgrades are not enough‚Äù, ‚Äúyou need to have above 4/4.3 of gpa, get hundreds of hours in research and clinical experience, win scholarships, publish‚Äù. I got scared, but for real, but I already knew this : before even starting my program I had already contacted researcher to join their lab. Week 2 of my bachelor : I had researcher assistant position. But I felt like a total incompetent and intrude. I never been in a lab in my entire life, didn‚Äôt pass a single exam and I got it almost first shot. So that was both scary and unpleasant. When I went to ask a question on a programming class to my neuroanatomy teacher for my job, he told the entire class (250 persons) that ‚Äúone of your colleagues already had a research job so everyone of you should hurry up because place at PhD are limited‚Äù. The entire class released a surprise ‚Äúahh.. omg‚Äù I was humiliated (my ears turned red), wanted to burry myself 6 feet under. But now I felt the pressure, because my classmate started to recognize me.

1 year later, I got coauthorship for an article published in A famous Journal. I don‚Äôt feel I own it : I feel like an intrude. I didn‚Äôt wrote a single line of it, I was just there to help with the analysis, put comments and correct it. I feel like it was a huge gift from the postdoc and director that mentor me. The article got accepted in first round because he did an incredible work. Not only it is rare to publish as an undergraduate : it is rare to publish it that journal and it is rare that it get accepted first round. I feel uncomfortable. I feel now the bar is set so, so high. Failure is at my door and I‚Äôm scare to disappoint them. My director wants me to prepare a presentation on my ‚Äúperspective on my first redaction experience, and give tips to trainee‚Äù (when I‚Äôm the youngest trainee in the entire team). I legitimately don‚Äôt know what to say: I feel and felt like an intruder for the entire process.

My classmates and colleague relly heavily on me and seem to except that I know everything, but I don‚Äôt. My director gave me a graduate level project to take over and I‚Äôve been freezing for 3 month because I don‚Äôt know how to manage it. I don‚Äôt even know what I want to do of my life anymore but I feel I have to act like I do, at least for being a model to my classmate that don‚Äôt stop asking me question to get to my position. but I have almost no one my age to rely on in return.

2705,"On a different Reddit group reframing came up and I wanted to share. Hopefully, it will add some value to someone. 

One of my professors in school would have me do reframing techniques and keeping a diary. It was a way for me to stop doubting myself so much, realize what I've accomplished and the value I've created.  The process reframed how I looked at some situations and how I looked at myself. 

I recently did this in a roundabout way. I hired someone to do a bio, career history for me for a professional reason. I couldn't see all that I had accomplished myself and was struggling to see myself beyond the tasks I had carried out. As I was working with this person and the questions they asked I realized I needed to reframe again because I had lost sight of my value and validity.

Reframing is a technique that can help us refocus our feelings of inadequacy and create a balanced mental model of how we perceive ourselves or situations. Below is a link to an online interactive app that allows you to reframe.  

Use this to realize failure is a learning opportunity and reaffirm your success, validity, accomplishments, contributions and value. Also if you have other ideas you want a different perspective on this tool can help. I don't know who created it I was just looking for a reframing worksheet and found this instead.

2708,"I am a person with pretty serious anxiety, depression, ADHD and imposter syndrome of some sort. Usually my symptoms/behavior are pretty manageable. But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.
* The usual imposter stuff--""everyone at work finds me annoying/doesn't want to work with me, I don't belong there,"" etc. etc. etc.

Does anyone have resources, techniques or methods to help deal with these delusions? I would like to tell my therapist about them, but he has not been super helpful so far, due to his busy schedule and tendency to medicate instead of digging deeper into what is wrong with me.",person pretty serious anxiety depression ADHD imposter syndrome sort Usually symptomsbehavior pretty manageable lately imposter narrative taking especially Covid stay inside fiancee long period Basically Ive discovered lot worldview consists persistent aggressive delusion Anyone claim like lying dont know 100 certain Anyone claim love merely tolerating saying love convenient purpose moment soon become inconvenient annoying difficult deal way feel certain withdraw love immediately make constant obsessive perfectionist brings end anxiety worthless worth person inherently selfish bad matter hard work thing always true nothing change usual imposter stuffeveryone work find annoyingdoesnt want work dont belong etc etc etc anyone resource technique method help deal delusion would like tell therapist super helpful far due busy schedule tendency medicate instead digging deeper wrong,anger

2714,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me ‚Äúthere were people who did not want to employ you‚Äù and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either ‚ÄúI think you are an idiot‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are now fired‚Äù. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...‚Äù. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn‚Äôt 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It‚Äôs silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don‚Äôt remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager‚Äôs manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I‚Äôve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it‚Äôs ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",Hi 2 year ago got job Fortune 500 company previously worked small scale startup huge jump excited start felt confident made first day Aaaaand started meeting people team would go something like hey name Adamfiction software engineer master x PhD worked IBM awarded insert achievement Aaaaand realised huge change culture culture shock every day daunting started feeling small used shame think accomplishment good enough would thing everyone work age somehow made much worse would talk meeting someone ask opinion would agree someone instead saying anything scared sound stupid One day line manager told ‚Äú people want employ ‚Äù comment needed reinforce belief around incompetence started actively avoiding colleague thought conversation would go either ‚Äú think idiot ‚Äù ‚Äú fired ‚Äù Saying seems insane time real one colleague invited talk corner booth started shaking convinced day fired lose everything laugh one team meeting said something along line ‚Äú new recent graduate might good idea ‚Äù head team pulled aside noticed imposter syndrome noticed avoiding people avoiding expressing saying thing way sound guarded introduced peer felt started changed life Finally someone relate first meeting started talking struggle cried 30 min telling feel worthless like supposed like hired mistake quota suggested get therapist something well took year month overcome come back every However try remember thing help feel better 1 reason selected among 100 people 2 work good important bit weird keep log thank emailsmessages get good outcome feel everything stupid read remember ‚Äô 3 Remember people different path ‚Äô silly since assume everyone age seems always accomplished remember start career try imagine people start career 4 People often ‚Äô remember conversation even think said something stupid chance walk away forget dwell week write script head prepare future conversation person 5 Rank important think someone line manager ‚Äô manager celebrity scared talk 6 Everybody start somewhere started tracking learned look back see far ‚Äô come 7 Might cultural thing ‚Äô ok acknowledge achievement mean bragging 8 engineer way people see 9 Asking question talking people sigh weakness 10 Sharing experience one easiest way build relationship,trust

2718,"I began working at a software company only a month or so after I graduated with my bachelor's, about 3 years ago.

The company, the owner, the department heads, and nearly everybody else is happy, super polite and nice, upbeat every day, Type-A, and really fucking smart. I didn't think I had any business, much less skill and social skills at all, to be working with so many people like that.

I was anxious, depressed, nearly throwing up every morning before work for months and months, and thinking I might be fired at any moment once they discovered that I was a fraud and not as smart as they thought I was at my interview.

I felt like such a fish out of water for the first year, at least, before I started to even get a little bit comfortable. Even then I only felt like I was barely holding my head above water with the knowledge that I gained of the software I had to support on a daily basis.

Every quarter, we have a full company meeting, this last one being held virtually today due to the shit going on right now. Before each quarterly meeting, everybody in my department submits a nominee from within our group to be employee of the quarter.

This morning, at our virtual meeting, it was announced that I had been chosen as Employee of the Quarter from my service department. I can't express in words just how much it means to me that the peers I work with, by majority, found that I had done, helped, and taught well enough over the last few months, while we all worked from home, to deserve that award.

I'm still over the moon, 12 hours later. Feels good man.

2719,"First off I enjoy social media. I really only use instagram and I never take it too seriously. My posts are all things that I genuinely want to post. From artsy pics to blurry pics that could've been better but it's whatever no biggie, to a meme here and there. I could care less about ""what my feed looks like."" I think it's hella sad how far people will go to have not only an aesthetically pleasing picture but an overall aesthetically pleasing profile.

One thing that I really like doing is posting music on my instagram stories. I usually do it when an artist has released a new song or I'll simply share a song that I'm extra feelin at that particular moment.

My thing is, I love music, I love the culture that it itself is and that it creates around it. I especially enjoy rap hip hop music. I've had friends ask me history questions about music such as NWA and stuff like that and in all honesty I won't really know all of it. I just listen to music and feel it. For as much as I'll listen to songs on repeat, I really suck at remembering lyrics and being able to sing along. Makes me feel like my love for it isn't genuine.

I'm in school and am now gonna actually commit myself, during my free time, to reading the history behind some of my favorite artists as well as the history of where it all began. There's just so much content and music out there. I love Lil Wayne, but I felt so bad a few nights ago when some friends and I were vibin to some old Lil Wayne songs, and my friend just outta nowhere knew all this history surrounding Lil Wayne and stuff like how he was the first and maybe only artist to have a #1 hit on Billboard while serving a prison sentence. I love Lil Wayne, I listen to his music everyday, when I work out, while I'm making my morning coffee. But yeah I just feel awful that I don't know his history. In all honesty, this goes back to there being so much content, I'm 23 years old, I grew up listening to Lil Wayne and those big artists back in my day, but in truth I've never really listened to 50 Cent song or Jay-Z song. Jay-Z?? I've only listened to maybe one or two of his songs. I love Kanye West's music but in truth I've also only heard just a handful of his songs as well, never sat through a whole album.

I get worried sometimes before any friday night hangouts with friends that any sort of music talk will come up. Cause they've always joked how I know my stuff.

2733,"Hi guys, I want to be a production artist for games(2D) and I've been working for hours every day practicing and doing studies. My art has improved a lot over the last 4 months especially and I feel like I'm a few years away from being at a junior level artist for AAA games.

I haven't been contracted yet because I don't actively market. On the other hand, I'm scared that If I am then I won't be able to deliver what is expected. I fear I won't be able to produce something that helps develop the game.   


I've been working on a summer game project as a concept artist with friends and I loved how things were turning out and I felt so great. But once again, the thought of being paid and having that expectation still freaks me out. Even in school, we have another game project that is a 28 week production and I'm the lead artist. Yet I'm still scared that I won't be able to deliver.

2737,"I've been having some serious doubts in my ability to code in a professional environment. I've been going through Colt Steele's Fullstack Web Developer course on Udemy. I sit down to start designing my portfolio and then good ole Mr.IS creeps in the back of my mind telling me ""no business would want my coding skills, psshhh skills you can't even code"" there have been moments I've just sat at my keyboard and cried because it's such a hard thing to wrestle with. 

Recently I've been fighting a wrongful termination with FedEx Ground. During my paid suspension I really hit that course hard working everyday on it. I was so excited when I made a very rudimentary To-Do list out of Html, CSS and JavaScript considering it was really my first time using JavaScript to create something. I go look at others portfolios for kind of the Do's and Don'ts. I see their portfolio and the projects they have and instantly start questioning if I'm really cut out for this. My wife u/mrsjamiel has been nothing but supportive and wanting me to finish this course but I'm just having a hard time of grappling with the imposter syndrome. 


The other thing that's causing this is, I finished the Frontend Web Developer section of the course. So now I'm doing backend. It's just alot because now it's more routing pages, server side code with Node.js GET PULL PUSH REQUEST REQUIRE RESPOND etc and it's like am I in way over my head? Can I really do a Fullstack app. Do I even deserve to call myself a Jr. Fullstack Engineer


To give another point, when I was at work one morning because we live in Phoenix it got extremely hot in the warehouse and moving packages from trailer to trailer takes a bit out of you. I told the manager I need a minute because it's just hot. He told me to go home because he didn't want me passing out on the dock.

I‚Äôve been a professional musician for 5 years now. In terms of performing, I have worked past my feelings of feeling inadequate. At this point it‚Äôs audio engineering and teaching that are a struggle for me.

As a teacher I‚Äôve been teaching online since 2018. I have nothing but 5 star reviews, but I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough for my students. I went to school for music and think I‚Äôm reasonably well trained, but I have this anxiety that with each student at some point I‚Äôm going to run out of helpful things to tell them and I‚Äôll just be getting paid to sit with them while they practice. I often get nervous during my lessons that students feel I‚Äôm wasting their time, but they come back from week to week. 

As an audio engineer I also started in 2018. I did not have a ton of experience, so I charged a small fee and did the best I could. I did NOT go to school to become an audio engineer, but decided to do it after college. I‚Äôve took an intensive course helping me to feel more confident in my tracking, editing, and mixing abilities, as well as joining an online cohort for 6 months to get feedback on my work. I‚Äôve put in time and I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with some great clients... but I am going to be working with a group signed to Warner Bros. and I just feel like I‚Äôm not worthy. I forced myself to take the opportunity, but I am really nervous about it. I am also working on an album for a vocal band right now and feel like I‚Äôm not doing them justice, despite saying they‚Äôre loving the product thus far. 

I try not to let my feelings of being a fraud interfere with my life and the business I‚Äôve built for myself... and I try to push myself to take opportunities even if I‚Äôm not comfortable with it...  but I know in my heart of hearts that my feelings are affecting my ability to do my best work and have periodically paralyzed me with fear.

2754,"Imposter syndrome is something I‚Äôve dealt with ever since I started my Master‚Äôs program.

Last night I met my SO's parents. They're well-to-do: Wealthy, accomplished, connected - the whole bit.   
They were completely warm and welcoming and the evening was fine. 

Although they are not in the least bit pretentious and did nothing to elicit these feelings, I left feeling inadequate and ashamed. I left feeling small. 

I am smart and have a career trajectory that I know people find impressive. In theory, I belong. But even so, I felt so much less than them. Honestly, afterward, I wanted to curl up into a ball. 

It's hard to divorce the person you are today from where or how you grew up. 

No amount of wealth or success seems to alter that internal, mental image of yourself as that kid from that not-so-great family. 

As I spend more and more of my personal and professional time with increasingly affluent, privileged people, I come to realize all that I didn't have growing up. It comes in waves, all things I do not know. Sometimes it's the small things (a butter keeper - what's that?) and sometimes it's the larger things, all the social norms of the classes above me that I'm still learning. 

I worry I stick out like a sore thumb. I worry I'm not worth the same as these other people. But then what is the worth of a human life? I know it's more than butter keepers and Ivy League educations.

2768,"My tutoring company has been doing remote work due to COVID, and they are starting to look into some in-person tutoring, given that both the client and tutor are comfortable. I have the option of being an in-person tutor again, in which I get paid a little more. I'm not personally scared of COVID from tutoring, so I am considering it. I worry though about being a good enough tutor. And so far the two students I've had who switched tutors‚ÄîI'm assuming because they didn't like me‚Äîwere ones I went to see in person, as opposed to in the office or remote. 

If I may vent, I was academically successful until college, at which point, I got by. I mean, I went to a prestigious STEM school and graduated in good standing with a BS in CS-Math. I think I got honors in CS. And I love helping people, tutored on-campus, and even tutored young kids over the phone. So I'm capable.

However, I'm not confident. And I don't do well under pressure. Like once I was doing an interview, I was asked to calculate the value of 5/8 without a calculator. I said 1.6 or something. At which point, the interviewer guided me to the realization that 5/8 is less than 1, so how is 1.6 reasonable?

I've had my tutoring job for less than a year. But I have been in it for over half a year, so I think I'm past the ""oh, you're new, mistakes happen"" phase. I believe I have the foundational knowledge I need, but I don't think I have the... sufficient knowledge that other tutors seem to have to confidently answer any kid's question. I find myself often saying that I need to get back to a kid on that. I don't know all the answers, despite having resources, answer keys, and time to plan. Nor am I motivated to give even more time to learning as I have already. 

So I feel like an imposter. Either because I am less competent than my fellow tutors or because I don't want to put in the effort I'd need to be as competent as them. 

Yesterday, I had one remote lesson to teach in the evening. All day I'd been anxious about it. It wasn't horrible anxiety, but it was present. And the lesson was fine. I expected it to be fine. But I still felt scared.

2770,"I have struggled with imposter syndrome since joining a prestigious academic engineering oriented program (where I earned 52 college credits) at my high school 4 years ago. I didn‚Äôt look like the nerdy boys (i am female) who also made it in, and I sure didn‚Äôt spend my free time doing science research since I was 5 years old like them. These guys were natural born NERDS and I am not. I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted to be an engineer and I felt so out of place, but I stayed in the program (even got an A in my Calc 2 class) with a 67% attrition rate. 

I graduated high school and am now about to begin college classes that scare the living shit out of me, and the confidence that I thought I would get from such success in high school is fading. I‚Äôll list out my courses for this fall semester (online classes because of COVID): Introduction to materials science engineering, Calculus 3, logic and computing devices ( and a lab that goes along with that class), electrical engineering (and a lab that goes along with that class too), and Biology for bioengineers. 

The fear that I am not cut out to be an engineer has manifested in my brain for too long.

 My bf says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what school is for ‚Äî to train yourself for the career you want‚Äù, but my immediate reply to him is that ‚Äúschool, for me, is to figure out that I am not good enough ‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt have any rational reason as to why I am not good enough to be an engineering, but I really truly do feel like I am not good enough.

I've been writing since I was 15 and I've just been promoted to an editor for my school newspaper after only writing for them for a semester. Apologies if I sound braggy but people have seemed to like my work in the past and I think I've gotten far considering my age.

2781,"New here. I work in film and theatre, or at least I'm trying to get into that industry as an actor/screenwriter/director. I like to do more than one thing. It's the sort of career where you learn on the job by speaking to other people and working with them. In short, you need to network like a fox. But I can't ask for help. If I did, I would be too terrified to be ridiculed and torn down because it's so obvious that I don't know what I'm doing and I would be exposed as a fraud, a pathetic laughing stock and a failure. But I need to ask for help to learn the skills to do my job. It's a vicious cycle. I grew up in the care system surrounded by narcissistic people and jaded social workers who just wanted to end the conversation and go home for their dinner instead of giving a shit about you or their job. Their favourite word was ""no"". Aiming to achieve anything other than working in a minimum wage job and living in a crap one bedroom flat was discouraged. So I had to go into every single meeting with them every 6-8 weeks feeling armed to the teeth for battle and it was exhausting. If I wanted or needed something I would have to plan an entire TEDx talk to get through it and if they found one single area in my idea that wasn't quite developed yet, they would be like ""AHA!"", and jump right in there to tear me down and keep me under their boot. I was constantly reminded of how I was a stupid little girl living in a fantasy world and had no idea what I was doing or what reality was. They would straight up make fun of you. But they never taught me anything to help me with normal life either because they want you to stay helpless and rely on the system, and then judged me for not having a clue how to do simple things despite it being their responsibility to teach you. You weren't allowed to do anything for yourself (and there were often consequences when you tried to) and then at a certain age, they expected you to just magically be able to do it. So now if I want to do anything at all, even the simplest of things like asking someone how I write a script, I can't. I'm too afraid that the rest of the world is exactly like them. I don't want them to laugh at me if I want to make films and have no idea where to start. If I try to overwhelm myself by doing everything, I fail. If I ask for help, I fail because I look like a fool and a fraud not knowing what I'm doing.

2788,"A quick note - I only discovered information about imposter syndrome within the past 24 hours and I feel like I have really discovered what has been happening to me most of my life. 

&nbsp;


Last year I was offered a Leadership/Management Internship position at Walt Disney World - something that I have worked towards since my high school grad in 2011! I was placed into housekeeping leadership though I had no prior experience in it (all my leadership experience was front desk or merchandise) so I felt like I was thrown into unfamiliar territory. 


&nbsp;


I was there for about 6 months (internship was for 1 year and a potential permanent position was available at the end of it), assisted in opening a new resort, and about 3 months in I began to have extreme anxiety attacks at work - I would lock myself in my office and cry and have trouble catching my breath. The role as a leader wasn‚Äôt difficult per se, the role itself was something that I could do on a day to day basis. I told my parents and my s/o that I was out-of-place, that I missed guest interaction (there was little to no daily guest interaction unless there was a guest to apologize to), and that I felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in.


&nbsp;


Whereas those were all the truth, I feel like I didn‚Äôt tell them the full truth. I am extremely terrified of failing and letting people down. I felt like in a position of leadership at this level, I had so much daily weight put on me and I was scared I would fail (even though I had only received praise from my peers and those above me). Eventually I was struggling to get out of bed for what was meant to be my ‚Äúdream job‚Äù, or at least the start of it. I began to question what I wanted to for so long. I left that position and took a general merchandiser position (non-leadership) within the parks and now I feel so unfulfilled but worried to try to step into a leadership position. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm looking for...advice or validation? I‚Äôm terrified of applying for another leadership position in fear that this will happen again..I have no idea.

One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

2791,"Hey there, new to Reddit here but made an account after finding this thread cause I need advice and also to rant a bit.

SO... I am going into my senior year of undergrad and I recently won executive board (eboard) president of my student organization, an org that connects international and domestic students on campus to learn from each other's cultures blah blah, it's really cool. This is the club's 3rd year. I was a very active member during my first year which was its first year. Then last year I was away the whole year on a study abroad program. I attempted to keep in contact as much as possible but I also wanted to enjoy myself abroad.  I had never given much thought into running for president but I knew I was very interested in being a part of the eboard; I wanted to help make decisions and be more involved in the club. So I had told the current president to let me know when elections would be and I would send in a video. THEN corona fucked us all up and I ended up having to come home early and the university and the club were obviously shut down too.

A few weeks after things had settled down a bit, I got an email saying that eboard elections would be happening soon. But there was one thing, I wasn't sure what I wanted to apply for. I knew I  didn't want to be the treasurer cause I'm not the best with money, but other than that I wasn't really sure. So I asked the current president, who was also a pretty good friend.  He texted back right away saying that I should run for president. I thought he was crazy, I didn't have any leadership experience and I can be pretty introverted. But I do have quite a bit of experience with cultural exchange and am super passionate about this club and cultural competency. So when elections came around I ran for president. I put a good amount of effort into my video for the club to watch and vote on.

As I waited to hear the results, it was then I realized I did NOT want this position. I had not been there this entire last year and hardly knew what new changes had occurred. I didn't have many new ideas of my own. I did not know how to lead people. Like AT ALL. I do not know how to delegate, I don't know how to plan things. And the thought of leading the meetings and yearly planning absolutely terrified me.

So the day comes, I won. I still have no idea how. I have two VPs and honestly they are both more qualified than me. One was on the eboard last year and the other works in the international student center and has been a very active member for the past two years. Both of them are also pretty extroverted and have lots of ideas for the club.

We've had a few meetings together now and I just feel like I am not bringing anything to the table. I am supposed to be the one telling people what to do and when but my brain just feels so jumbled with self doubt and pressure to keep up an image of something I know I'm not. I can feel myself not matching up to the two VPs. They constantly bring up things we should be thinking about and planning for and I feel so stupid having not thought of them myself. They also keep saying, ""last year the eboard would..."" and it just keeps reminding me that I wasn't there.

I'm scared that as time progresses I am just going to fuck up a club that I'm really passionate about. It feels like I'm walking into a final exam that I never even attended any of the classes for.

I guess I'm asking myself, and you're probably wondering as well, why I even ran for president. Well, I supposed it's because I wanted to be on eboard and this is the first thing that was suggested to me. I wanted to gain leadership experience but how can I do that when I constantly feel like I'm not bringing anything useful to the table and feeling so so lost on what to get done, who to talk to, when to plan what, and what I'm supposed to say to people.  I've never felt worse imposter syndrome in my life. I don't know how I'm going to keep this up for the year.

Anyone have any advice on leading people when you have no idea yourself?",Hey new Reddit made account finding thread cause need advice also rant bit going senior year undergrad recently executive board eboard president student organization org connects international domestic student campus learn others culture blah blah really cool club 3rd year active member first year first year last year away whole year study abroad program attempted keep contact much possible also wanted enjoy abroad never given much thought running president knew interested part eboard wanted help make decision involved club told current president let know election would would send video corona fucked u ended come home early university club obviously shut week thing settled bit got email saying eboard election would happening soon one thing wasnt sure wanted apply knew didnt want treasurer cause Im best money wasnt really sure asked current president also pretty good friend texted back right away saying run president thought crazy didnt leadership experience pretty introverted quite bit experience cultural exchange super passionate club cultural competency election came around ran president put good amount effort video club watch vote waited hear result realized want position entire last year hardly knew new change occurred didnt many new idea know lead people Like know delegate dont know plan thing thought leading meeting yearly planning absolutely terrified day come still idea two VPs honestly qualified One eboard last year work international student center active member past two year also pretty extroverted lot idea club Weve meeting together feel like bringing anything table supposed one telling people brain feel jumbled self doubt pressure keep image something know Im feel matching two VPs constantly bring thing thinking planning feel stupid thought also keep saying last year eboard would keep reminding wasnt Im scared time progress going fuck club Im really passionate feel like Im walking final exam never even attended class guess Im asking youre probably wondering well even ran president Well supposed wanted eboard first thing suggested wanted gain leadership experience constantly feel like Im bringing anything useful table feeling lost get done talk plan Im supposed say people Ive never felt worse imposter syndrome life dont know Im going keep year Anyone advice leading people idea,trust
2792,"I guess I just need to get this out and see if this mirrors anyone else's experience.

Or if I'm just completely out of my mind.

My therapist definitely believes I have impostor syndrome. This is based on some information I explained to him. In my classes (senior in college), for example, I received an A on both term papers for both courses last term, a 97% and a 98%. And I am still waiting for the grade to be lowered because SURELY these professionals have to figure out that it's all fraudulent. The school I go to uses turn it in and I am able to see my results, both had low %s meaning the content was original, yet I'm still convinced somehow I must've cheated on the assignments. Logically, I know I did not, I remember the painstaking and grueling hours reading the research, putting them together and writing it out in the APA format. I also did well on the quizzes. I can't fathom that I have gotten those grades on my own but I know, logically, I did.

I am also a community activist locally. I don't do anything major or impressive--but it requires me to confront politicians and community leaders with a ton of stats and facts. I am known for my skills in researching and strategy on these topics. I am by no means a mastermind. But I am often able to cite case studies and statistics --yet, even though I've done the hours of research, written them down into an essay, presented them and even have had them double checked, I constantly have to re-check the information before speaking on them again, as I am convinced I have them wrong or made them up. 

This all sounds like impostor syndrome to me--but the part that I never hear about it and I wonder if anyone else deals with this or if its a totally different ""syndrome"". I don't just expect to exposed as a fraud, I expect to be exposed as a horrible human being. I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, most of which I've at least made an effort to atone for, but I am constantly waiting for my ""horrid actions"" to bd exposed--and often times, they are imagined actions or they are based on real events but ""modified"".

One example and I know this sounds strange: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up 3 years ago (almost). And it was a nasty fight, I was crude and petty. The relationship NEEDED to end. I regret how I ended it. But we made amends for both of our wrongdoings throughout the relationship and while we've maintained a healthy emotional distance since then, when we see each other (pre-COVID) we say hi, we've had some small social media interactions and we've even discussed the end of our relationship. In fact, we respect each other very much and the relationship. Yet, nonsensically, I've ""imagined"" him ""exposing"" me as this horrid person who destroyed his life. I know that's not going to happen and it's not true--but it has become to the point that I actually thought I was going to lose all my friends and my standing in my community over it. But there's no actual basis for this. 

I also am frequently expecting the law to come to me and ""catch me"" for the horrible crimes I've committed. I fear being caught, but not for anything I've done, but rather, that I'll be ""planted"" and charged. Now, I am a community activist but not high level enough to worry about that happening.

All of this is based on non-sense. And I have not been diagnosed with anything like psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't have auditory or visual hallucinations. But I am constantly surrounded by guilt and feelings of inadequacy, which I believe is beyond the average persons standard of self-doubt and insecurity.

Thank you for letting me share and I know I sound ""crazy"". If you have any advice or resources, or similar stories (even if you would prefer to share them in a private message), I'm here to listen.

2798,"I am new to this sub but I wanted to throw a suggestion out. One of the pieces of advice I received about managing imposter syndrome was to keep a running list of positive feedback, accomplishments (big or small), successes, and compliments to reflect on and help to combat feelings of incompetence and not belonging.  

I wonder if folks on here would find any value in having a weekly thread where everyone could just comment with their weekly successes, accomplishments, or positive feedback received. I was thinking there would be no expectation about what success (etc.) means. Someone could write that they remembered to water the plants this week or they got a B on a paper or someone complimented the way they drafted that email or they felt like they might look dumb but they mustered the courage to ask that question in class anyway. The central idea being that it might help us remind ourselves that we do have skill, we are competent, we do belong. It could be a way for us to support one another as well. 

One potential downside I could see is that if folks are listing their successes it might make someone feel more like an imposter if they don't feel like they have something to contribute. Or with the process of upvoting someone might feel bad because they only got 2 but someone else got 10. But my hope would be that we could all support each other in whatever successes people post whether it seem small or large. If folks are interested we could assess how it's going after a few weeks or so and make sure it's helpful, not harmful.

2801,"I‚Äôve had IS for quite some time and it‚Äôs ruined my ability to form relationships with people who just want to support me. I can‚Äôt take a compliment or accept their praise and they get frustrated, even verbally angry at me for not ‚Äúunderstanding my worth‚Äù. This has lead to tension between my mother and I because she always wanted to uplift me and I felt guilty, as she was wasting time and energy on me. I then feel guilty that I‚Äôm rejecting love and support when there are a lot of people who are not fortunate enough to have a mother so loving. It‚Äôs sends me in a spiral, further enforcing my belief that I don‚Äôt deserve anything good, I was just lucky enough to be given a mom like her.

She passed away 7 months ago. I never got to tell her how grateful I am to have her constant support while I was struggling, (with mental illness and sobriety). I miss her more than words can describe.

One thing I hate is people telling me that I‚Äôm doing surprisingly well dealing with her death, which I take as a back handed compliment. Shouldn‚Äôt I be grieving more dramatically because she was so important to me? Why am I happy sometimes even though she‚Äôs gone? Are people expecting me to relapse because of the tragedy? How can people say that they admire my bravery and strength to carry on, especially when I spend hours stuck in the past, trying to remember her?

I feel like I‚Äôm only ‚Äúdoing surprisingly well‚Äù because I have shoved everything down and I am not working hard enough in therapy to address my grief, I‚Äôm only repeating what I‚Äôve read in books or posts of what the stages of dealing with grief look and sound like. I lie about my feelings to everyone, even my therapist. My therapist praises me for not relapsing into self destructing habits, but I feel like I haven‚Äôt fallen back on those because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint my mom, even though she is no longer here. The idea that I‚Äôm ‚Äústrong‚Äù is scary to me. I feel like these compliments create so much doubt in my head, causing me to relapse because that is what is expected of me. 

Through all of this, I don‚Äôt have my mom‚Äôs unconditional support to fall back on when I feel my life is a sham, I don‚Äôt have that one person who loves me no matter who I think or pretend I am. It‚Äôs tricky navigating my thoughts and feelings alone and I feel like I‚Äôve been killing myself looking for reassurance from other sources, like my work or social media, so much so that I have neglected working on my relationships with my family, who is hurting too. I don‚Äôt want to let them down the same way I let my mom down so many times, nor do I want to have them worry about me, or spend time and energy trying to support me as I will never truly feel validated. They should just continue believing I am ‚Äúdoing surprisingly well‚Äù even though I know I am faking it.

2804,"Hi all,

I'm here to share my story and wondering if anyone has any advice... a long post ahead (apologies).

I moved to a new country in mid 2018 with a job in a field I wanted to be in.

Prior to my move overseas, I was doing pretty ok at my job and enjoyed it well enough to keep going everyday.  I entered into the field as a graduate and did pretty well there. My job involves analytical thinking and using numbers on a daily basis. At school, math has never been my forte and I've always felt a sense of anxiety towards it for a number of reasons (e.g shamed in front of peers, parental pressure etc.). However, when I moved overseas and got a job in the same field, things started to go downhill.

The overseas job was fundamentally similar to what I was previously doing, but much more complex and customised work. I was making errors and mistakes on basic stuff. My anxiety increased exponentially and everyday I felt like I was going to be revealed as someone who is incompetent. I did my very best and worked really hard to double, triple check my work but it was a cycle of stress and anxiety as I felt less confident and would catastrophize every situation in my head (e.g. I'm going to get fired then get deported...) Coupled with the fact that my boss was a grammar nazi and had really strong eye for detail... I lasted a year and a half before I was let go.  Self sabotage much!

(I also have to note that my errors never led to any projects fallen apart, nor did we loose any clients over my work. It was the small things that added up to the whole.)

It was a tough time because I felt like an absolute failure. My boss and my colleagues had finally discovered the ""truth"" about me...

I've been lucky to get a job relatively quickly since then as I was already looking for other roles before I was let go, but feel like the situation could end up similarly if I don't change and overcome this ASAP. I've already found myself making a few simple errors and this has triggered some anxiety again.

I'm working through some parts of it through a therapist (there's a host of other issues relating to self confidence and childhood trauma which are all connected), but not sure if I can financially sustain it in the long run.

There are a few things I have been working on to try and manage and stay in control.  For example, I'm actively trying to improve my mathematical ability regularly, keep a check list of 'must-dos', exercising regularly to manage my thoughts. Since going into the new job I've tried my best do things differently to what I did before even on simple tasks. I've told my self that it's my 'system of working' that's not working - not a fundamental judgement of my ability and self.

What I do enjoy about the job is that it gives me experience to work on interesting projects and have an impact.

My plan is to stay for a minimum of one year in this new role while I try to find something else.  At the end, perhaps I'm just not suited to this job... Or am I just having a hard time letting go? Am I really an imposter?

Any thoughts or advice to manage all of this? :) It would be really welcomed and appreciated!",Hi Im share story wondering anyone advice long post ahead apology moved new country mid 2018 job field wanted Prior move overseas pretty ok job enjoyed well enough keep going everyday entered field graduate pretty well job involves analytical thinking using number daily basis school math never forte Ive always felt sense anxiety towards number reason eg shamed front peer parental pressure etc However moved overseas got job field thing started go downhill overseas job fundamentally similar previously much complex customised work making error mistake basic stuff anxiety increased exponentially everyday felt like going revealed someone incompetent best worked really hard double triple check work cycle stress anxiety felt le confident would catastrophize every situation head eg Im going get fired get deported Coupled fact bos grammar nazi really strong eye detail lasted year half let go Self sabotage much also note error never led project fallen apart loose client work small thing added whole tough time felt like absolute failure bos colleague finally discovered truth Ive lucky get job relatively quickly since already looking role let go feel like situation could end similarly dont change overcome ASAP Ive already found making simple error triggered anxiety Im working part therapist there host issue relating self confidence childhood trauma connected sure financially sustain long run thing working try manage stay control example Im actively trying improve mathematical ability regularly keep check list mustdos exercising regularly manage thought Since going new job Ive tried best thing differently even simple task Ive told self system working thats working fundamental judgement ability self enjoy job give experience work interesting project impact plan stay minimum one year new role try find something else end perhaps Im suited job hard time letting go really imposter thought advice manage would really welcomed appreciated,trust
2807,"I'm in a really weird situation right now: I am a college senior, finally getting involved in the field that I really love. It's surreal because the people I am working with are the best of the best and I know I don't belong here. I messed up my GPA a lot last quarter, and so it's not imposter syndrome -- just inability.

2809,"I‚Äôm a recent graduate of a physics bachelor‚Äôs program and I‚Äôm in the last stages of finalizing my undergraduate research paper with my former advisor. It‚Äôs taken me a full 4 years to get this paper done (which seems like a while but it was hard to balance it with classes). Long story short, I‚Äôve realized that there are a lot of mistakes in my paper: calculations, conversions, that my advisor thinks I‚Äôve done (which i did do 2-3 years ago) and these are things I just flat-out have no idea how to do anymore.

Sadly, it‚Äôs not like my advisor doesn‚Äôt know I have anxiety issues and can get in my own head very easily. I‚Äôve worked for him all through school.

I know I have to ask for help in order to get this done and I only have a bachelor‚Äôs degree so i shouldn‚Äôt beat myself up about not understanding Master‚Äôs/PhD level physics concepts but I cant help it (especially considering i‚Äôve applied to PhD programs recently)

I just keep wondering how I got this far, graduated with multiple honors and scholarships and feel like I got so lucky with many of my achievements though on a higher level I know I worked my butt off for them.

I am a medical student in the US and imposter syndrome hit me hard when I first started medical school - someone people have told me that it never really goes away so I should just find a way to deal with it through various wellness practices. 

While I still feel it now, a couple years ago I was overworking myself to the point where I was not eating all day until 8-9PM, not taking breaks, and not being social so I wanted to write a post for anyone who can relate to my experience. It took me a long time to acknowledge that I have imposter syndrome and that's totally okay, but because I realized that now I try as much as I can to not let it dictate my life. 

If you are all interested, I write more about my experiences in my blog (I have a lot of down time right now because all of our clinical work is suspended).

Or if both are in the same field and in the same office (say, both are programmers and work on the same project, they check each other's codes occasionally). One is honest and gives good review, the other degrades the other persons coding skills (even if they are obviously on the same level) and eventually the downgraded person will start believing that they're really not good enough.

I wonder if this is impostor by proxy or something else like gaslighting? Maybe it's gas lighting but the result, impostor syndrome, is the same. But it fo.es by a proxy bot by themselves even if it then continues to com from themselves... is this even coherent? Do I make sense?

But my question is this: although I may have deserved the ACT score, does it really mean I‚Äôm smart enough to do well in the future? I‚Äôm beginning to believe more and more that I‚Äôm just good at test-taking, and that I don‚Äôt really retain enough information to keep myself afloat in the future (like college and a career).

From the lab reports, to the upcoming test (that everyone will  more or less bomb), I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and starting to think that this is one of a few classes to really represent what college and a career will be like, and making me feel generally ill-prepared for my future.

2875,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

2884,"What's the psychology behind Imposter Syndrome?

If I were to reply that question based on my experience with imposter syndrome, I'll say it's because I expect people to acknowledge my capabilities the way I imagine I'd have done it to someone else. But how often do I compliment someone else irl? It's quite rare that I pat on a friend or a relative's back to celebrate their accomplishments. This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.

I feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions. This is why this sort of compliments feel diluted like it's not meaningful enough to digest as truthful.

However, in real life, I work as a software developer and whenever my boss or the seniors compliment me (which rarely happens) on something I did, suddenly all of that worries instantly go away but unfortunately, it's only temporary. I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.

A potential cure?

I think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us. For me, those people are my parents, my brother, my boss, the seniors at work and a couple of colleagues in my rank. I believe that if one wants their imposter syndrome to completely go away, they're gonna have to maximise the amount of compliments they want to generate from these meaningful people. The compliment may not be physically expressed but it could also be subtle as in an increase in the respect people have for you.

In order to please those people, you're gonna have to 'git gud' in life. Work on yourself constantly, keep improving yourself. Always be active. Always ask for something to do. Try to work on the bank of knowledge of your department if you work in software. During my spare time, not only do I browse Reddit but I have tabs of research materials open. I gather knowledge which my team will need in the future and I present them during meeting.

Work your way up the hierarchy of competence and you'll notice your imposter syndrome will slowly fade away. The way people will look at you will be different. They will smile at you. They will be happy to work with you and to me, that's the one effective way to combat against that horrible, horrible thing called imposter syndrome.

""How could this possibly be my life?"" I felt like I was sitting in a chair inside my own mind, not in control of my situation, and as if I had navigated myself to a place where I shouldn't be. I felt SO stupid because along with this, I felt the uncontrollable urge to start crying and I think my supervisor noticed (one of my new coworkers conveniently went to check up on me after I saw her leaving his office).

I have no reason to think I'm going to fail at this job, honestly the staff is super supportive and knows I'm new at this, I am just SO overwhelmed with anxiety, imposter syndrome, and a feeling like this is all doomed.",Ive dealing imposter syndrome ever since graduating college general think Im stressful time lot plate Im starting new job Im excited first big girl job year struggling college However Im extremely terrified time dark feeling like Im going fail Last Friday attended orientationtraining work panicking day constantly reminded unprepared felt actually start job afternoon meeting really weird experience never seen happen like stronger version imposter syndrome meeting describe feeling moment clarity except moment genuinely feeling like get get hired could possibly life felt like sitting chair inside mind control situation navigated place shouldnt felt stupid along felt uncontrollable urge start cry think supervisor noticed one new coworkers conveniently went check saw leaving office reason think Im going fail job honestly staff super supportive know Im new overwhelmed anxiety imposter syndrome feeling like doomed,anticipation

Essentially, I feel like I've just been pretending to be smart my entire way through university. Like all I've been doing is just copying information from sources.

Even my dissertation. I just feel like I took information from organic chemistry books and websites and that I don't actually deserve any credit because if I hadn't had resources I wouldn't have been able to have done it. It's like I believe that if I didn't just *know* something without having to research it first that I don't really know it at all, even if I made sure I understood everything before I wrote about it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it. I just feel like I'm not actually an intelligent individual and I'm just really good at pretending to be. I look at other people who're graduating from the same course as me and think they must know more than me or they must actually deserve it compared to what I've been doing.

Now I'm not at uni anymore and I'm applying for jobs, I'm terrified that I'm not capable of working in the industry I've been studying for the last 3 years. The longer I spend applying for jobs and not hearing anything back, the worse I feel, because there's obviously a reason why nobody's responding to my applications.

I just feel like I've been given a good degree for lying about being smart and that now I'm not going to be able to use it and I just spent ¬£27k on something I'm going to have on my wall whilst I work in a supermarket because I can't get a job anywhere else.

I did poorly at school, not because I am unintelligent but because my home life was unpleasant and  I was bullied at school.

I now have a good job that pays a decent wage.

Here‚Äôs the problem ... it‚Äôs the way I got the job. 

The job is in an industry that I‚Äôve been in my whole life but not in a field of the industry that I am that familiar with.

The company I worked for prior to this one went through some restructuring and my job role was included in that, I would‚Äôve had to relocate.

Someone I used to work for has become a dear friend and let me know about a job in the company her husband works for, he is now my manager.

I applied, interviewed with him, interviewed with his boss and was offered the position.

I have been in the job just over a year now and feel like I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. We recently had a meeting with lots of colleagues and I felt out of my depth and panicked.

I felt like I didn‚Äôt have a good enough awareness of what is going on in my marketplace, I felt like I don‚Äôt know enough about my customers and competition.

I feel that sometimes my boss thinks I‚Äôm stupid and that he only employed me as I am friends with his wife.

My annual appraisal was good and I met or exceeded expectations but this was written by my boss with no consultation at all. We had no meeting to discuss or one since.

I reason with myself that it wasn‚Äôt just his call and his boss must have thought I was capable to do the job too.

But almost daily I am calling into question my capability to do this job.

I've been here for 3 months now. The first big project I've had is a branding project for an organization's program. We presented concepts to the client and while they didn't completely freak out and call it OMGZ AMAZING, they were still really well received and they liked it.

1. i did get accepted into a *really* good college, which i committed to, but i feel like i shouldn't have because a) its easy to get in, hard to stay in, so ill probably drop out anyway. b) everyone is gonna be so much smarter and better than me. c) it costs so much to pay international tuition and even though my dad said its okay, i feel really bad for choosing the more expensive option d) my grade aren't even that great
2. i feel like i shouldn't have friends because i'm always thinking about what i don't like about a person to make me distance myself from them, i'm always the afterthought friend, i always feel like i have to put up a front for each and every person for them to like me and i'm just lying to everybody. I also constantly feel like every nice act that someone does to me is fake. it's like in my head if: someone compliments me = they're being fake nice out of manners, someone does something nice for me = they're pitying me. this is even down to things like homework.
3. ever since i was a kid, my parents constantly compared me as inferior to my older sisters, so every single decision in my life that i made has been to distinguish myself from them. my grades are better, i got into a better university, i'm more ""obedient"" to my parents, etc yet i still get ""why aren't you as smart/responsible/organised/blahblahblah as your sister?"". To family and friends, my sisters are the ""successful one"", the ""smart one"" and i'm always, ""the one that's good at looking pretty"". I want to be recognised as intelligent and ambitious too. The other day my sister got her hair cut in the same haircut that i've been planning for two years (she didn't know, so it isn't her fault) and i got so upset about being compared to her if i did cut my hair like that (we look really similar), that i impulse cut my hair a really different hairstyle.
4. i feel like everything i do isn't enough. when i got accepted to college, the first things my mother asked me were ""on what grounds?"" ""can they take it back"" and then ""where is (name of my friend she really likes) going? medicine? omg i'm so proud of her!"" and every time my college topic comes up, she only talks about my friend and how amazing she is. my mother hasn't talked to me about college once. today, while we were taking about a trip that i'll take alone to my hometown, i told her my sister and her boyfriend would pick me up from the airport, and she said to me, ""nobody cares enough to go that far for you.""

2925,"So I've read about imposter syndrome somewhere last year and felt as if it described me. However, I also felt as if I was lying about my thoughts and feeling about this, as if they were not as valid as those of another person. 

I've had some things happen to me in my life, bad stuff, that have left a mark on me. But everytime I want to talk about it to someone or feel sad about it, my thoughts are telling me that ""there are people who have it worse than me"" or that ""my problems aren't really that bad"", ""I'm only trying to get attention"" and things like that. So I end up holding all my feelings and sadness inside because I feel like no one will take me seriously.   
I feel as if I will only be valid after something REALLY bad has happened to me idk... Everytime I go through bad stuff, I convince myself it wasn't actually that bad and if I dare to complain about it, I am only hurting people who actually went through bad stuff so I'd better shut up.  
e.g. I had a boyfriend once who hit me twice and held a loaded gun to my head 'jokingly', he manipulated me into doing stuff for him I didn't want to do, even sexually. However, this relationship only lasted between 3 - 4 months. So I tell myself it was only a short amount of time, there are people in similar of even worse situations for years so just shut up about your little problem because you are hurting these people. Idk, is this normal?? 

I also feel like I'm a fake with doing things I like. Like photography, my studies (applied psychology), writing... I never own these things like other people do. I tell myself I am actually not good at any of this stuff so I end up not practising enough to actually get better. Or when people give me compliments on something I did, I tell them everything that went wrong, or how it is not as good as how person x did it, show them imperfections, talk about the help I got from others... And actually end up covincing these people I am not good at things. I kind of undermine myself. 

Phew, this is a lot to get off my chest... 

Any similar experiences or advice??

2928,"idk if this is the place for this.   like trying to get into a new thing, a new franchise.  actually, pretty much anything ive been a part of i often feel like im not a 'true fan'.   so for example, something old that i liked since i was a kid was pokemon.  i started out with the first games, RBY.    i dont really feel like an imposter for liking pokemon, but sometimes i still do.  but even moreso is something like street figther.  i never played traditional fighting games until a few years ago, with Street Fighter V.   i really want to like it, but i feel like such idk, an outsider? a fake? both.   i wasnt a part of the community that followed the games from the originals.   i like the storyline, the lore, but since i wasnt a part of it from the beginning, i feel detached from it somehow.  like its not a part of me and never will be.  whereas pokemon, its practically part of my identity (maybe thats a bad thing too, basing myself off of external things, trying to see myself in characters and not seeing the characters as separate entities from myself, but i have always struggled with knowing myself in general).     


but its just especially prevalent with new things. i cant get into things easily.  i constantly think about the people who know more, have been around longer, are better at the videogames, what have you.   makes me feel like trying to find ""my"" thing, but i dont have a thing.   ""jack of all trades, master of none, better than a master of one"", but that doesnt feel true. i wish i was really good at one thing.  i feel im straying from my original issue, but well, its that i cant commit to anything.  my passions are flimsy, i never feel completely immersed in anything--instrument, music, movies, drawing, videogames, skilltoys; i do all these different things but i never completely can give myself permission to just enjoy something fully.  i always feel sortof detached no matter what i do--and that also prevents me from really excelling at anything, i think.     


but it also feels like a depression thing.  it feels sorta cyclical; cant get immersed-->dont feel enjoyment-->cant get immersed.  which came first, idk, but the result is me being more or less numb.    and t his extends to so much beyond just liking things. its like part of who and how i am.   like afraid to be real.  so afraid that i forget how to stop being afraid, and when i start to mellow out, i get anxious becuse suddenly there's a weight to everything.  to social interactions. to the real world.  and then i go numb again, because its safer to have this hyper-aware, low level anxiety combined with a detachment from personal feelings, than to actually feel.   but feeling is what makes life worth living, obviously.   gotta take the good with the bad, or neither and end up with nothing.  but the bad psyches me out to the point of giving up on anything i started to be passionate about--thus cyclical.  its like my choices are: feel too much, or feel nothing.  yeah this is definitely beyond just imposter syndrome, but it also feels like it isnt. like its a part of imposter syndrome. ",idk place like trying get new thing new franchise actually pretty much anything ive part often feel like im true fan example something old liked since kid pokemon started first game RBY dont really feel like imposter liking pokemon sometimes still even moreso something like street figther never played traditional fighting game year ago Street Fighter V really want like feel like idk outsider fake wasnt part community followed game original like storyline lore since wasnt part beginning feel detached somehow like part never whereas pokemon practically part identity maybe thats bad thing basing external thing trying see character seeing character separate entity always struggled knowing general especially prevalent new thing cant get thing easily constantly think people know around longer better videogames make feel like trying find thing dont thing jack trade master none better master one doesnt feel true wish really good one thing feel im straying original issue well cant commit anything passion flimsy never feel completely immersed anythinginstrument music movie drawing videogames skilltoys different thing never completely give permission enjoy something fully always feel sortof detached matter doand also prevents really excelling anything think also feel like depression thing feel sorta cyclical cant get immerseddont feel enjoymentcant get immersed came first idk result le numb extends much beyond liking thing like part like afraid real afraid forget stop afraid start mellow get anxious becuse suddenly there weight everything social interaction real world go numb safer hyperaware low level anxiety combined detachment personal feeling actually feel feeling make life worth living obviously got ta take good bad neither end nothing bad psyche point giving anything started passionate aboutthus cyclical like choice feel much feel nothing yeah definitely beyond imposter syndrome also feel like isnt like part imposter syndrome,trust
2929,"Ok, am I right or am I right that of the types of ""imposters"" there are, the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist"" types are absolutely the most screwed, pwahaha ([https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one))? Think about it. For the other imposter types listed, even if internally they feel like a mess, there are still some external benefits to their internal insecurity.

1. The perfectionist will still strive for that 100%. Even if they do miss that 1%, they are still going to probably be 99% better than most people.
2. The superwoman/man will work harder than anyone else. Even if they are insecure, their efforts show up in their work and gain them respect.
3. The expert gathers every piece of information and knowledge that they can. Even if their knowledge is incomplete, they still know more than probably the average person.

But the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist""? Lord help them. And by Lord help them, I mean Lord help me LMAO.

1. The soloist is fighting a losing battle. They are trying to go it alone WHILE also trying to be perfect. We all need mentors and teachers to help us to learn things! People will think that you are arrogant because you are trying to learn things on your own. And you most likely will also fail because who can succeed without the help of others?
2. And the ""natural genius""? Oh my goodness, this is even worse! Think about it: this person (me, lmao) delusionally thinks that they can excel WHILE on minimal effort AND on their first try. They give up easily at the sign of any challenge, because that's a sign that they aren't ""good"" or ""talented"" or ""smart"" enough. Therefore, they never actually excel at anything.

I feel like the first three (perfectionist, superwomen/man, expert) are almost like ""productive"" imposters. People that feel like imposters, but at least do something about it that can somewhat productively counteract those feelings.

But the bottom two, which I unfortunately am? It's like where you feel like you are an imposter, and instead of at the very least compensating for it, you just try to hide it... by trying to go it alone so that no one can see your imperfections at least for a short while (soloist) or by only ever sticking to things that are ""easy"" so that you can pretend like you are some sort of ""natural genius"" of some sort. 

Not to say that any of these are objectively supposed to be considered as ""good."" But I guess I'm just a little bit frustrated with myself...

2933,"I'm 20 years old now, grew up being told I was smart, have talents and even won an award in 7th grade called most likely to be a millionaire. My mom hangs it proudly in the house for show. She smiles when she looks at it.

Since then I went on to play chess at a national level, my first tournament I did poorly. The whole time, feeling like I was gonna be exposed, that my district wasn't good enough, that these smarter more intelligent kids would find me out. I capitulated. After that, my dad got drunk, told me I wasted his money and I never played it again. To this day.

And that's been a theme for me ever since. Since the age of 15. Had a bad bout of depression that seemed to come from nowhere, got into drugs and such, meth, codeine and self destruction. Got lucky, studied hard and went to college and now I'm 2 years clean.

But I'm still suffering the same thing. I no longer have the confidence to speak in a group of people, I always fear that they will remark something true about me. Figure me out before I finish.

Can't make many friends neither, they always seem to find out how weak I am and take advantage of me. Especially with women, I'm black so I date black girls. If you know black girls you know how mean they can be. Or maybe that's how I want to think of them.

They say I'm not bad looking, so girls sometimes get attracted to me. When they do I panic. Not because I'm scared of them, I've had girlfriends before but broke it off before they got too near. When girls want me I run away, I'm so afraid that they'll know what I'm all about. That I'm just a smoke screen for nothing that lies behind, hollow as can be.

Can't even walk in public in peace, always feel like somebody can see through me. I don't know how to explain it, sometimes people remark things that cut to the core.

Been called many things that were true. I can't even be around my step family, probably only 4 people in the world I can be myself around. Even then I think they're just entertaining me, laughing at me in secret. Criticising me. Maybe.

2934,"To give details but not too specifically, I attend an elite university on the East Coast. I gained a full-scholarship there and gained a full-scholarship in high school too. Although, I have grown to be OK with rich people, in high school, I deeply resented almost all of my classmates as I felt that it was unjust the circumstances I grew up in (living with family in one bed room apt, subletting,  being food insecure, and even cleaning offices/houses with my mom on weekends). It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter. I had nightmares very very often and would wake up at like 4 or 5 AM to edit group presentations just so i wouldn't let other people down. 

In college, it's a lot better since people can't come over and what not and are somewhat more mature. But, now that I am an upperclassman, I feel an immense pressure to go into IB/Finance. I received some Bulge Bracket firm interviews and even made it to final round, but didn't get the summer internship. I felt like I was a failure to my family and to myself and to the expectations of my colleagues in college. I don't know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel that IB/finance is meant for the rich and that they ovviously have an upper hand while I have to fight to get myself a position. Even stupid jocks get jobs just b/c of alumni connections. It's just discouraging ......

2935,"**EDIT:  I cross-posted this to** r/askpsychology **, and am much calmer than I was when I first posted.  I have settled into a tired, calm numbness, but I don't think that it is a bad thing, given the circumstances.** 

&#x200B;

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female.  I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work.  Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon.  My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack.  For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

&#x200B;

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud.  As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear.  I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome.  I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too.  Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it.  I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

&#x200B;

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten.  I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after.  I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter.  I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME.  I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me.  ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ <--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it.  I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

&#x200B;

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself.  But I am definitely in crisis.  The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline.  The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it.  I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me.  I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me.  That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

&#x200B;

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work.  I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth.  I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents).  I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is.  He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere.  I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me.  So I try to make him as happy as possible.  He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

&#x200B;

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life.  And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have.  In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can.  I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON.  Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine.  But I lie.  My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason.  I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day.  I ignore them.  One of these bills is for $8.  Eight fucking dollars.  I'm paralyzed about it.  I won't fix it.  These are only a few aspects of my life as examples.  I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships.  I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having.  I lie about having other plans.  I deserve to have my life fucked up.  I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway.  At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it...  It feels like my whole world is upside down.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, thank you.  I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this.  The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

&#x200B;

This is the first day of my life.  Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where.  I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing.  I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

2936,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn‚Äôt put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn‚Äôt. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family‚Äôs and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if‚Äôs. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it‚Äôs why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I‚Äôve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what‚Äôs looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don‚Äôt look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it‚Äôs offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don‚Äôt have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We‚Äôll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don‚Äôt feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don‚Äôt treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven‚Äôt earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn‚Äôt earn it, that‚Äôs bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that‚Äôs where you go so ride it out. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don‚Äôt go down the dark hole there‚Äôs nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

2937,"This was originally posted in [r/confidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence) and r/Anxiety but it's obviously hugely relevant to this subreddit:

Hi all,

I (27F) have always had ups and downs with anxiety, confidence and insecurity. I'm going through a rather difficult patch at the moment. I'm a journalist and I've just started a new job. I used to work on long form documentaries but making the switch back to daily news is really daunting.

I went through a very competitive interview process to get here, and I've always received very positive feedback on my work in every other job. So logically, I should feel like getting this job is really well-deserved.

However, the other members of the team are extremely good - intimidatingly so. There are many people here with a lot more experience than me (even the more junior members of the team) who seem to be far fuller of ideas than I am and much more vocal. They approach their work with a confidence and conviction that I can never see myself having.

I am much shyer than my coworkers and struggle to speak up in meetings. I have been trying to force myself to do this more, and even recently spoke at a public event to try and gain more confidence. It hasn't got any easier at all, and I still cringe when I hear myself speaking in front of a large group. I don't feel like my ideas are as original, creative, fully formed and well-thought out as the ones many others pitch. I spend hours researching topics I'm interested in, but I struggle to form proper stories out of my ideas and therefore don't pitch very often. I know I should arrange a meeting with my boss to talk about these issues, but I feel like they are always so busy and I don't want them to think they've made a mistake by hiring me if I highlight my insecurities.

Because I'm so intimidated by my coworkers, I feel reluctant to start conversations or even make small talk with them, even though I know I would benefit from doing this and learn a lot from them. I know it actually looks worse that I'm not taking the time to engage with them, but the thought of doing so makes me anxious.

I just feel like a great big fraud, really. I want to become a really good journalist, but I know this anxiety and lack of self-esteem is really holding me back.

Does anyone else here have similar experiences at work? Any tips that might help?

TL;DR: I'm struggling with imposter syndrome at work and it's affecting my ability to do my job and form relationships with my team. Any advice or details of similar experiences much appreciated!",originally posted rconfidencehttpswwwredditcomrconfidence rAnxiety obviously hugely relevant subreddit Hi 27F always ups down anxiety confidence insecurity Im going rather difficult patch moment Im journalist Ive started new job used work long form documentary making switch back daily news really daunting went competitive interview process get Ive always received positive feedback work every job logically feel like getting job really welldeserved However member team extremely good intimidatingly many people lot experience even junior member team seem far fuller idea much vocal approach work confidence conviction never see much shyer coworkers struggle speak meeting trying force even recently spoke public event try gain confidence hasnt got easier still cringe hear speaking front large group dont feel like idea original creative fully formed wellthought one many others pitch spend hour researching topic Im interested struggle form proper story idea therefore dont pitch often know arrange meeting bos talk issue feel like always busy dont want think theyve made mistake hiring highlight insecurity Im intimidated coworkers feel reluctant start conversation even make small talk even though know would benefit learn lot know actually look worse Im taking time engage thought make anxious feel like great big fraud really want become really good journalist know anxiety lack selfesteem really holding back anyone else similar experience work tip might help TLDR Im struggling imposter syndrome work affecting ability job form relationship team advice detail similar experience much appreciated,fear

I also had a friend who was anxious about getting sick and dying because of every little discomfort (hypochondriac) and it made me scared that I could have the same disorder instead of being actually sick.

One moment I feel like this thinking has had a major impact on my physical health because I didnt take symptoms seriously, then I feel like an imposter who only feels sorry for themselves.

I have imposter syndrome from my relationship.

He always mentions starting new projects and gets really excited, when he shares his thoughts an ideas. I like listening to him and helping out with ideas, but latley it's been really hard to accept myself.
We both take interest in the same area, but I don't have as much experience as him. That leads me to feeling terrible about myself and my work. I try to cancel out the thoughts I'm having, but they come back. It has gotten to the point where I have trouble feeling motivated. I find distractions, but only end up hating myself even more.

I have gone back to school, and will be finishing my AA this semester. I want to pursue a degree in biochemistry but I'm absolutely terrified of the intimidating classes.

I did got all A's in my college algebra course, my chemistry course, and am currently doing very well in my biology class. BUT it's still at a community college so I know the material is dumbed down quite a bit. 

I just feel like I'm not good enough and that I don't belong to play with the ""big boys"". I mean I know the classes are hard for everyone but I'm scared and considering a different career.

2979,"Hi everyone! I am new here. So, I was on a law students reddit page a while ago and came across the term Imposter Syndrome. I got curious and googled the term. After that, I searched and took Imposter Syndrome quizzes online (I know its not reliable but I just want to see how I fair) and turns out that every single one of the quizzes I took said I have a high tendency or possibility of having Imposter Syndrome.

Looking back, I think I identify with the signs of having it. I have been an achiever since I was a kid. I was a consistent Honors Student (Straight As) from Elementary to High School. In college, I did well too. I was consistent Deans List and graduated Cum Laude. I was Managing Editor of our College Newspaper and competed and won regional and national titles in Journalism competitions. 

Went to law school and did fairly well again. Took the bar only once and passed. I was a lawyer before I was 30. 

My whole life I was expected to accomplish high feats. People see me as an achiever. But to be honest, I dont see myself as such. I always think that I might be good but someone will always be better than me. I always think that I should have accomplished more rn at my age but i havent. I feel like all other friends, classmates I had have already come a long way.

I feel like whenever I make a mistake, people starts talkingbehind my back and talk/gossip abt me not being good at what I do. I feel like all the accolades and hardwork I did doesnt really make me capable. I dont like talking abt my achievements or being complimented coz I feel embarrassed. I just wanted to be lowkey. I remember passing the bar and when I was congratulated I said I was just lucky. 

I thought all these are just normal and a part of me being the introvert that I am. But when I came across the term ""Imposter Syndrome"" and read abt it felt like a glass shattered (like in HIMYM episode called ""Spoiler Alert"" lol) and it all kind of become clearer to me. I dont know who to talk to abt this so I looked for a group here on reddit hoping to get to discuss or maybe help me understand abt this more.

2982,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day.

Almost every time I'm interested on something, say sports, music, reading, I get this weird feeling that I'm faking everything, which makes me feel bad when talking to other people about those interests and also while I'm focusing on them.

It's like I think I'm supposed to know everything about something if I'm interested in it. Otherwise I'm just posing.

Just to give an example, there's this rock band I love and some years ago I showed them to my mom and more recently showed her their new album. On the other day my mother told my about this oldie song from them which I didn't know. It is an awesome song, but at that very moment I started feeling like a poser, because if I don't know that song then I don't really know anything about the band and I don't really enjoy them, I'm just faking.

2. Reach out for support - you're not alone, many people go through this
3. Keep reminders of past successes - build a bank of successes you can reference to snap out of it.
4. Practice positive self-talk - refer back to your past successes to be kind to yourself 
5. Manage your thoughts - we think 60,000 thoughts every day, some of those thoughts are trash and you don't have to believe them

2995,"Quick, who is your favorite author?

One of my favorite authors right now is Michael Wickett. He's an accomplished Nightingale-Conant motivational speaker and author. His book, ***It's All Within Your Reach*** is one of the best I've ever read.

I hold him in high regard because of that book.

Most, if not all of us, feel the same way when it comes to authors. Statistically speaking, about 80 percent of the American population wants to write a book, but so few embark on this journey. If I had to guess, I would probably say that many people do not believe they have what it takes to write a book, which, at the root is simply fear. But, I once heard Les Brown say, ‚ÄúWhen your why is big enough, you will find you how.‚Äù

I‚Äôm going to lay out 10 reasons why you should write a book and maybe, just maybe after you read them, you will find you how, and if not, I promise to help you.

## Reason #1: A book is an instant confidence booster

As I mentioned at the outset, how do you normally feel about authors? Do you treat them differently from the average person? What sort of impression do you get when you're introduced to an author?

When people perceive you in a high and elevated way, you begin to feel better about yourself. It‚Äôs an instant confidence booster. Most people treat authors as celebrities. And imagine if your book hits Amazon's #1 Best-Seller Status. What would that do to your confidence and self-esteem?

I know I felt great when mine hit that status. Not in a prideful or boastful way, but just proud of myself and what I‚Äôve accomplished since the death of my mom. I know she would be proud of me as well.

## Reason #2: A book allows you to see your value and potential

Author John Maxwell said, ‚ÄúMany people fail to grow and reach their potential because of low self-esteem.‚Äù

When I was depressed and contemplating suicide, my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I could not see any value or worth in my life. But I was motivated by the thought of a postage stamp and so I began to add value to my life, first by exchanging my negative thinking for more positive ones, I began to exercise, eat healthier and start back fellowshipping with my congregation.

When I began to write, I learned to get out of my head and to see my real potential and value as a human being. If you don‚Äôt realize you have genuine value or that you're worth investing in, then you‚Äôll never put in the time or effort required to grow.

One of my favorite motivational speakers Zig Ziglar said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with how we see ourselves. We can positively do very few things if we feel negative about ourselves.‚Äù

I know for a fact, that every aspect of our lives is directly impacted by the way we see ourselves. When you write and pour out your heart onto paper, you see how far you‚Äôve gotten in life, and all that you've accomplished.

## Reason #3: Writing a book is an opportunity for self-reflection

Have you ever gone to therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. Going to therapy helped me cope with being sexually molested as a young girl. Well, I get that same type of help every time I sit down to write. Writing allows you to dig deep within yourself. You are alone and vulnerable and you're able to work things out on paper that you can‚Äôt do when they stay locked up in your head.

Writing forces you to reflect on your life. Most of the time, when we take the time to self-reflect, we see patterns that we need to change and habits we need to develop.

When I was in the fifth grade, my amazing teacher, Mrs. Battle brought a snake into the classroom and we had the privilege of seeing the snake shed its skin. It was the absolute most captivating thing I‚Äôd seen at that time. When I write, I also see myself shedding my old skin, my old thinking, and my old dishonoring ways for a newer, better version of me.

Writing has allowed me to change my life and the byproduct of that is I‚Äôve changed the way I think about myself. I no longer see myself as a victim. I am strong and unbreakable. By the way, so are you.

Our lives are so hectic. Learning to pause allows growth to catch up to you.

## Reason #4: Writing a book allows you to flex your brain power

Did you know that our brains weigh about three pounds? It is such a small organ, yet it packs a punch. When you write, even when you're writing your own story, inevitably you will have to do some research, whether that be interviewing your family members or hopping onto Google to get some facts or now, AI ChatGPT.

Our brains are muscles. Just like any muscle it needs to be flexed or it will atrophy. Writing allows you to flex your brain. When you step outside of your comfort zone you give yourself a chance to explore new things about yourself. One new point discovered can lead to other points and you never know where that can take you. I‚Äôve learned that to be a success, you first have to think it and the only way you start to think it is, either you change or something in your life forces you to change.

Nothing in life remains the same forever.

Writing helps you to determine your future. You can write your ticket in life or continually allow someone else to force you to write theirs. Stop thinking in terms of ‚ÄúCan I‚Äù and start thinking in terms of ‚ÄúHow Can I.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow Can I‚Äù puts a different spin on things. It‚Äôs the beginning of a high-value question that prompts you to figure it out. Start asking the right questions and your brain will begin to give you better answers.

## Reason #5: A book is an ideal way to create side-hustle income

Most people that I come into contact with would love to someday work for themselves, whether it's for financial freedom or just because they want to spend more time at home with their family.

When you write a book and you get the title of #1 best-selling author attached to you, people are going to take notice.

Published authors are considered experts and authorities in their field. If you had a book, do you think you could send that book to a business prospect? How do you think you would be perceived by that person? Would it be difficult to land that contract? I don‚Äôt think so.

Writing a book positions you as an authority. This fact can help you sell more products and services which will ultimately impact your bottom line.

Would you like to earn more money just by writing a book?

That would be a yes for me too.

Just think, what if you were allowed to get paid for sharing with other people information you already know?

Now, perhaps unlike at any other time in history, if you possess knowledge that other people would be willing to pay for, you can start making money, with little or no startup costs, especially with the help of AI.

Teaching online grants you the freedom to still work a day job yet generate side-hustle income. Today, it‚Äôs a real possibility to even make just as much money while you're asleep as when you're awake, thanks to the power of the Internet and AI.

You have the opportunity to teach and share what you're most passionate about with large audiences. Would you like to share what you love and be paid for doing so?

So now are you beginning to see how finally earning what you‚Äôre worth by sharing your knowledge and expertise with others would help boost your self-confidence and self-esteem?

## Reason #6: A book will help you get over your fears, even your fear of public speaking

Have you ever noticed that authors are usually asked to speak at conferences or seminars? Well, my friend, the same will be true for you. I know, but you‚Äôre afraid of speaking, right?

Well, the only way to face any fear is to stand up to it. We overcome our fears by doing the thing that we fear. Here are three other ways to overcome fear:

* Define your fear. When we face new situations in life, we normally imagine the worst-case scenario. But, did you know that you can dramatically shrink your fears by simply putting them into words on a piece of paper? See how writing helps you to slay fear.
* Accept the challenges that fear presents to you. Instead of shrinking back and giving fear the upper hand, accept fear as a normal part and life and act despite it. A great tool from author and speaker Mel Robbins of The 5 Second Rule, really works. Try it. When you want to do something, just count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and then do the thing that you fear. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ‚ÄúDo one thing every day that scares you.‚Äù
* Think of the benefits of acting in the face of your fear. Think of what it will do for your self-esteem and self-confidence. A good exercise is to physically write down the benefits you will gain by forging ahead. The thing to remember is that every decision you make is helping to form the person you are becoming. Do you want your fear to define you or do you want to take that scary risk and come off the victor?

## Reason #7: A book will help you be more productive by raising your standards

Do you find that you are easily distracted and not being as productive as you can be? Well, writing a book during a challenge will not only help you with your productivity it will also help you with developing discipline, determination and just plain grit.

When you write a book, it‚Äôs just you, the blank slate, and now AI. Writing helps you remain singularly focused on the task at hand. It is an exercise in discipline and time management. If you stick to it, your determination will give way to a beautiful masterpiece. And no, it doesn‚Äôt have to take months anymore, it can take a weekend. I will show you how to write 10 books in 30 days.

Let me ask you a question, what's the difference between something you should do and something you absolutely must do?

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, ‚ÄúThe things easy to do are also easy not to do.‚Äù In other words, the things you should do are things that are easy not to do and so you don‚Äôt do them. Some of these things are:

I should eat healthier.

I should exercise more.

I should treat my spouse with respect.

But when you absolutely must do something, as if your life depended on it, there is a shift and change in you. If eating healthier meant you would live or die, then you most likely would do it. The same with exercise and treating your spouse with respect, if your life depended on it, you would make the necessary changes.

When you raise your standards and turn ‚Äúshould‚Äù into ‚Äúmust,‚Äù you are making an inner shift to take control over the quality of your life. Any area in which you are not getting what you want is because you haven‚Äôt raised your standards.

According to Tony Robbins, ‚ÄúMost people, if they look at how they are living their lives today, will find that their identity is based on a set of standards and a set of beliefs they created 10, 20, 30 or more years ago. Many of us made decisions when we were kids about what to believe, what we are capable of, and who we are as a person, and that became the glass ceiling that controls us. But are you the same person you were back then? Are you the same person you were even a year ago?‚Äù

I‚Äôm just going to say it, you have to demand excellence from yourself. Don‚Äôt be mediocre. Be world-class. Don‚Äôt settle for the status quo, be relentless. Pursue excellence. ‚ÄúPeople are rewarded in public for what they‚Äôve practiced for years in private,‚Äù said Tony Robbins. Never ever give up. Raise your standards. Writing will help.

## Reason #8: A book will help you develop bullet-proof habits

To complete your book, you have to have good habits, otherwise, you‚Äôll never get it done.

In 2008, after my mom died of colon and liver cancer, a few years later, I developed the habit of getting up at 4 a.m. and going to the gym. That habit has helped and sustained me all these years. I knew I had to do something to get my mind out of the loop of negativity. I knew I had to physically move my body because where my focus goes, energy flows.

With that said, I started researching other high achievers and came across Brendon Burchard. Brendon has been studying high achievers for over 20 years and the biggest secret he has learned when it comes to habits is ‚Äútrigger moments.‚Äù

In essence, trigger moments are cues that remind you to activate your intentions or habits.

I use my iPhone to create my trigger moments. A lot of people underutilize this great feature on their iPhones. Right now, I want you to take your ‚ÄúClock‚Äù then hit ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù and then add your alarm time. Then under ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù write out your goal ‚Äì the same one you have a picture of on your board. Press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. Repeat this step three times for each of your goals. So from now on, every day at that time, you‚Äôll be reminded to accomplish your goals. This is how you attack from all sides. You have the vision board, you have the alarm and now let‚Äôs move on to tip number three.

My all-time favorite bullet-proof habit device is pen and paper. When we track what we do, things get done. As an example, I started using my Apple Watch to track how many steps I take in a day. Before I had this device, I never walked 10,000 steps, but now that I track it, I make sure I do it every day. The same is true with any habit you form. When you write it down and track it, you will see the needle move, your results will encourage you to continue going. This helps to build momentum and you will become unstoppable. Writing has a funny way of doing that.

## Reason #9: A book helps boost your self-esteem and allows you to expect more out of life

Scientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But today, they‚Äôre learning more and more that we respond to what the brain expects to happen next.

Neuropsychologists call it the expectancy theory. Basically, through a lifetime‚Äôs worth of events, our brains learn what to expect next ‚Äì even if it does not happen. And because our brain expects something will happen a certain way, we often achieve exactly what we anticipate.

Do you see the dilemma?

If you don‚Äôt expect much to happen in your life, then, most likely it won‚Äôt. But if you do expect something great to occur, it most likely will. The difference is that you have to believe it will happen to you.

But how do you get that belief?

Simply put, you need to build your confidence.

**Confidence is built through action.**

A great start is simply writing down on a piece of paper, what it is that you want and expect out of life. When you put into words what you are thinking in your head, it becomes real. You now have a way to make a plan and start seeing some forward movement in your life.

In a talk at TEDx San Francisco, Mel Robbins, self-help author of the book, The 5 Second Rule, mentioned that scientists estimate the probability of your being born at about one in 400 trillion.

Do you know what that means?

It means you are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal pride. You are extraordinary. There has never been anyone exactly like you in all history of mankind on the earth. You have amazing untapped talents and abilities that, when properly directed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want or dream of.

In essence, your very existence proves you are a miracle. So start acting like the miracle you are!

In a CD by Earl Nightingale, titled, The Strangest Secret, he says, ‚ÄúYou become what you think about.‚Äù So what are you thinking? What are you constantly feeding your mind on? Your mistakes or your accomplishments?

Your thoughts trigger images and pictures and the emotions that go with them. These images then trigger your attitudes and actions. Therefore, if you think about success, you will feel strong and competent, but when you think about your mistakes, you will inevitably feel sad and weak.

We attract into our lives that which we think about. Whatever our dominant thoughts are, that is what will show up for us in our lives. To have more self-esteem you need to think the thoughts you would be thinking if you were already achieving your goal. Writing is a great place to start.

## Reason #10: A book helps you create and leave a legacy for your friends and loved ones

When my mom died, I wished she would‚Äôve written a book, just a story about every aspect of her life that I failed to ask about. She was an extraordinary woman that I didn‚Äôt have enough time with. I do however have a few of her songs. She was an amazing songwriter, and that‚Äôs where I get my ability to write. Thanks, mom.

When we leave this earth, a few mementos and memories are all we have left of our loved ones. What if you had more? What if you had a book that detailed the lives of your mom, dad, grandparents and more? What if you left that to your children and relatives? How would they feel? How proud would they be? Could it perhaps encourage them to confidently go after their hopes and dreams?

I believe writing a book helps create your legacy. In our digital age, there's no telling who else will be touched and inspired by your thoughts and words. At the outset, I asked who was your favorite author or writer, what if they never wrote down that very thing that inspired you?

I believe we not only owe it to ourselves to write a book, but we owe it to the universe and the generations coming behind us. Do what author Steven Pressfield suggests in his book, The War of Art. In the last pages of his book, he says that if you don‚Äôt do the thing you were meant to do, you, not only hurt yourself, you hurt the planet. He says, **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you got.‚Äù**",Quick favorite author One favorite author right Michael Wickett Hes accomplished NightingaleConant motivational speaker author book Within Reach one best Ive ever read hold

3001,"Sometimes it feels like my actions are geared, all of the time, to prove my imposter syndrome right. I applied for a job, genuinely believing I wouldn't receive an invitation to interview. I couldn't sleep the night I applied because I was humiliated at the thought of someone reading my C.V. To my surprise I got a call to interview. Shortly after that call, I told myself that they had already chosen another candidate for the job, and my invitation for interview was only because they had to fulfil a certain quota of interviewees. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well after that either.

Anyway, I performed poorly in my interview today and I didn't get the job. What do you know, my imposter syndrome was right all along. Running narratives like: it was silly of me to apply in the first place, why did I think I would've gotten this anyway, of course they had someone else in mind, I'm not skilled at interviewing so why would I even bother. I remember beforehand sitting in the interview waiting room thinking it's not too late for me to run away, cancel the interview, save the shame. 

What is this (imposter syndrome) about? Is it a perverse sense of self-preservation? Never fully committing to believing in myself, because the fall from grace would be too great? Feeling like I have to run harmful stories about myself, so that I can 'get in' before any threat enters? It doesn't work though. I still feel a bit upset despite 'expecting failure' - maybe because I realise that the way I treat myself is unfair, and ultimately doesn't get me anywhere.

Still, things I'm proud of (because fuck you imposter syndrome):

* I proved I can get to interview stage, gap in C.V. be damned 
* I can get through an interview, maybe not \*successfully\*. But the world didn't end. I'm alive. I'm here. The embarrassment of trying (& trying & failing & trying) won't kill me.
* I have accomplishments that speak for themselves and experiences to back it up. This is actually the objective truth and imposter syndrome can't take that away.
* I'm still breathing. And I'll try again and continue on with as open a mind as I can muster.",Sometimes feel like action geared time prove imposter syndrome right applied job genuinely believing wouldnt receive invitation interview couldnt sleep night applied humiliated thought someone reading CV surprise got call interview Shortly call told already chosen another candidate job invitation interview fulfil certain quota interviewee Needless say didnt sleep well either Anyway performed poorly interview today didnt get job know imposter syndrome right along Running narrative like silly apply first place think wouldve gotten anyway course someone else mind Im skilled interviewing would even bother remember beforehand sitting interview waiting room thinking late run away cancel interview save shame imposter syndrome perverse sense selfpreservation Never fully committing believing fall grace would great Feeling like run harmful story get threat enters doesnt work though still feel bit upset despite expecting failure maybe realise way treat unfair ultimately doesnt get anywhere Still thing Im proud fuck imposter syndrome proved get interview stage gap CV damned get interview maybe successfully world didnt end Im alive Im embarrassment trying trying failing trying wont kill accomplishment speak experience back actually objective truth imposter syndrome cant take away Im still breathing Ill try continue open mind muster,anticipation
3002,"I've been struggling with imposter syndrome my whole life, I am not sure how I got through my Bachelors and Masters studies in engineering, I have 5 years of work experience in research and development and two months ago I defended my doctoral thesis. Right after this doctoral exam I got some very uplifting feedback from one of the professors saying that I impressed him with being able to answer all of his questions - and it felt like for the first time in my life, I had overcome my imposter syndrome. But, I had a job interview yesterday at my dream workplace and I've been crying for hours since. The head of r&d was there together with two section managers, one of them had interviewed me three months ago and initiated this second interview. He warned me on the phone that the head of r&d was going to put me under a lot of pressure with his questions to test me, and that I should not be intimidated by it. During the interview, he asked me so many questions within my field of research, and I just couldn't answer them, because I am embarassingly bad at remembering formulas. I regularly look them up because I simply can't remember even the basic stuff. Stuff like, what is mechanical power? And he could find all my weak spots and was so arrogant, sadistic even, and now I am questioning myself, how did I even end up getting a doctorate in engineering? And the other two interviewing me were so nice, they never would have tested me this way but now they heard how I can't answer high school level physics questions. I am not sure how I can confidently resume my work in engineering without feeling like everyone knows I'm a fraud. I worked so hard but always felt like trying to hide that I actually only know just enough to not get exposed.

3004,"I got an scholarship for university in Europe, for someone from South America, this is like ""Wow you are a big shot"" everyone sees you as a promising person. Someone who is smart, and will be good because of it. Will make the family proud.
Everyone will shower you with praising, with things, with celebration because you are leaving to set yourself above .

But then i start not catching up, not being able to understand classes. They feel like a blur, and then suddenly finals. I fail. I made friends in my course, they see me as a smart person, one that can explain stuff to them. But they pass and i dont.

**Identify and challenge your limiting beliefs.** While they have many guises, most limiting beliefs can be distilled down to two essential beliefs: I‚Äôm not good enough & I‚Äôm not worthy. We may also carry over beliefs from our early years which served us well then but now hinder us as adults.

**Recognize ‚Äì and celebrate - your small victories.** Whatever small victories are meaningful to you. Within the context of having strategic plans, each small step is a victory in itself and also a step towards something so much bigger.

**Take responsibility for your current situation.** When you take responsibility, you take control. And when are in control, you have options and choices.

**Take a step each day toward your ideal self.** We all have the same 168 hours each week ‚Äì that‚Äôs just physics ‚Äì the issue is what we choose to do with them.

3026,"Hello I am new here M (24). I have been a poor student ever since I can remember. I failed 5 grade (who fails 5th grade ffs?). I am not a poor learner or stupid by any means but I was never able to get even average grades. A lot of which had to do with the nature of my dad‚Äôs job. We moved around a lot, including abroad where I lacked proper schooling.

11 and 12 grade are super important in our country because they decide the university you will get in. I was so badly prepared for 11 that I decided to repeat. And when I repeated I failed. I had zero hope of getting anywhere.

But still I applied to every university possible. I knew that would only get into shitty ones. But by an absolute stroke of luck I got into a very good university (top 5 or something). I had an excellent entrance test score somehow and I forgot my result card so they just assumed I passed 11th grade (which I later did but not at the time). Very lucky.

University life was super tough for me. I had to study twice as hard as other to get half the results others were getting. I was so very close to failing multiple courses every semester but somehow I always managed to pass by slimiest of margins. My GPA was only 2.58/4 (that too thanks to COVID) but I graduated in 4 years. Very lucky again.

I started applying for jobs before my last semester even began. I was starting to see how my low GPA was holding me back. Everyone who started applying after me got the jobs they wanted. I was left behind. Felt extremely bad but I kept looking. 

My cousin referred me to a Big 4 firm. They don‚Äôt hire from our university, they only hire CPA or ACCA and i was just a Bsc student. The hiring process is also very tough. Tests and interviews. I gave my best and somehow I cleared it all. Turns out they were very short staffed so they made an exception for me. Very lucky again.

Its been 3 months and the job is going fine. But I do feel dumb compared to others as their knowledge is way more then me. I still do my best, I always pretend that I know shit when in reality I don‚Äôt. I constantly live in this fear that one day I will be exposed and it will all come crumbling down. They will know I just got into university by luck, i got into the firm by luck. In reality I don‚Äôt have the credentials for this job. I failed 5th grade, I failed 11th twice, i hardly passed university.

On the other hand many people who know me believe that i got into university and the firm because my father is somewhat influential. That is absolutely not the case. He dint even know I applied to these place till I got in.

It hurts a lot living with this fear everyday.  I hate this and sometimes want to get out and quit. I have no idea how to over come this fear.

Anyone else feel this way? I feel like such a fake when thinking of having imposter syndrome. I'm doubting everything, I'm not sure if I even have it, so can someone clarify for me please?

I'm so anxious I can't do things, I'm a college student, and I'm constantly comparing myself to my class of individuals, and I'm putting myself at the bottom of the list where I've been told im intelligent. I see it, but it feels like I've hacked the system or I've lied, I doubt myself every single day, and when my friends were discussing mental health, imposter syndrome came up. I researched it, and I feel like a fraud for saying I have all the ""symptoms"" the website told me. I've recently gotten out of an abusive friendship, who really made my mindset the way it is today and its really impacted my life negatively, I'm not sure if I really have imposter syndrome, but I know I constantly feel like I'm pretending to be intelligent, lying to my friends about my grades and so on so forth. I'm so scared that people will find out I'm lying, even though I know I'm not? Does that make sense?

It's been starting to hit me lately, my mom said I'm the weirdest person in the family and I often hear that I'm one of a kind but I take those statements as compliments because I appreciate being my own person but I think the awareness is making it harder to feel normal as myself.

I'm always trying to remind my coworkers to be mindful when they say mean things and I feel like a hypocrite when I do because who am I to correct them even though I make a conscious effort to be mindful. They've told me I can't change the world on my own but they also told me that I don't talk trash which is encouraging.

When I'm with my boyfriend and I tell him that I love him sometimes it's hard to look him in the eye because I feel like he won't believe me. I can't keep my hands off of him which worries me more that he'll think it's lust when I just love him a lot and I feel a transfer of that energy when I touch him. 

It is the most confusing thing to be so sure about my connection with someone and the solidity of the relationship but to also second guess it knowing that there is no reason to.

3040,"Why now? Why not 14 years ago when I was still a wide-eyed and green junior developer?

It took several discussions with my wife to finally drill down to the reasons. First, my parents taught me perfectionism and that either you're a winner or loser. It's been haunting me ever since, and is probably the root of my Imposter Syndrome. I have this built in mechanism that shuts me down unless I'm at the top of the food chain. Next, the field of cyber security is one of immense talent, and it's honestly becoming very hard not to compare myself with my coworkers. Especially when your bonus is tied to performance and feedback. It gets to the point where my performance anxiety halts any progress I was attempting on a project. And now I'm stressing about my performance evaluations... So why did I choose this job, well it's because I want to be seen as ""the expert"", so I choose difficult jobs that force me to learn. It worked for over a decade until I've reached this point. It's like the Dilbert Principle but applied to anxiety.

I'm at the point where I'm considering taking a massive pay cut just so I don't need to perform; like a boring job fixing shitty bugs in obsolete enterprise code.

It was first postdoctoral position after finishing PhD. I got ADHD diagnosis at 36yo soon after it all went down. In hindsight I see imposter syndrome as an important part of breakdowns. It dented my confidence so much my former employer mentioned it even in termination notice as one of the main reasons for this decision. Naturally, during PhD impostor syndrome was there at all times. Main ""reasoning"" why I'm going to be fired were common ADHD symptoms: forgetting, chaos, lack of planning skills etc. I covered it all by working much more than my peers, hence I felt I don't belong since others didn't have to work that hard to be there. 

Edit: As for my partner, I couldn't take that she offers me a significant help to tackle the issue with the job, so I moved out from her. Yes, I loved her (still do) more than anything, but the impostor feeling of messing up her life because I'm a failure was just too hard to take, so I packed up my shit and left her place.

*edit: the ‚Äòhighest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it‚Äôs one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt belong there

‚Äî-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I‚Äôve been more insecure than ever lately & I‚Äôm having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‚Äòranked‚Äô #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don‚Äôt always say everything - but let‚Äôs just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it‚Äôs because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‚Äòhonors/cum laude‚Äô grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I‚Äôm not trying to say I‚Äôm absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I‚Äôm not actually super talented, I‚Äôm just good at ‚Äòtaking exams‚Äô + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I‚Äôm neurodivergent and am quite ‚Äòslow‚Äô in understanding things (even if it‚Äôs something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren‚Äôt so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‚Äògrade‚Äô I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I‚Äôm a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

I want to caveat this post by saying I know how lucky I am and that I have realised suffering is relative and money does not mean happiness. Not by a long shot. 

On paper life is great. Earlier this year I came up with an idea with some friends and we build this company which we promptly sold (finalising last week). At the same time, ive met a woman of my dreams. Loving, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.   


Last week, I got paid for selling the company. I now have more money than I know what to do with and the love of a beautiful woman. Everything should be great right?   


When I got paid out last Friday I started having panic attacks and questioning my happiness. Not so much if I deserve it but coming to terms that, somehow, for reasons I cant really put my finger on I am not happy. I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in my life at a fairly early age but it has caused me to realise that I didnt even know what I truly wanted.   


I started withdrawing into myself in regards to my relationship almost immediately. Questioning my feelings and thoughts for this person who is changing my life for the better on a daily basis.   


I asked her for some space to try and figure this out and it backfired. Badly. To the point where she is saying I need to figure things out before I can ""have others in my life"".   


I now dont know what to make of it all. I am coming to terms with my new life but after working so hard for so long and going nowhere and being alone for so long only to have achieved all this ""success"" in both my personal and professional life so quickly has left me confused, anxious and extremely emotional.

3057,"I‚Äôm kinda realizing a glaring issue I have that tremendously hinders my time management and my school/life balance in general  

I‚Äôm a graphic design major. The first step in every project (or, like, project extension) is research. We research subject matter, connecting themes and concepts, color pallets, design styles, font choices and parings, design techniques etc. It‚Äôs an important part of our process, and then comes sketches and executing our chosen concept. (This all will be relevant in a min)

I‚Äôm in a super competitive design program. Two portfolio review processes not before, but after semesters of design classes. Only 40 of the 400 end up making it. 
It was hell, but it‚Äôs my senior year and I‚Äôm almost finished. I used to really like graphic design, I was passionate about it. I worked my ass off to make it through the portfolio reviews.  I think I placed my whole identity and self worth in my ‚Äòdream career‚Äô. I had so many anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns during the portfolio review portion of this degree (the first 2 years). Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about passing the review, but I think i was mentally in fight or flight mode for so long that my brain is still recovering and something isn‚Äôt quite right. 

Despite making it through both reviews, My confidence is shattered. I second guess every decision I make. Everyone around me is so talented and I feel like a fraud. I‚Äôve worked really hard to get here, but I‚Äôm so burnt out I can barley function. I have pretty strong negative associations with school, class, my work, and myself. 


Every single night, we have assignments and things we need to present in the next class. And every single night, the same cycle repeats.

I research, research, research. I spend hours stuck gathering inspiration, jotting down concepts, all because I‚Äôm afraid of moving onto the next step. I don‚Äôt eat meals, I don‚Äôt spend time with friends, and I‚Äôm not even doing any of the ‚Äòreal‚Äô work until my internal clock kicks in maybe around 3 AM or in the morning before class. It‚Äôs always rushed together and I‚Äôm never proud of it. Because I‚Äôm never proud of my work, doing homework the next day becomes even harder. My brain does NOT want to move past the research step. Ever. I never feel ready. I loop myself into a constant cycle of spending WAY to much time on a meaningless first step, neglecting the important work, and feeling shitty about myself. I‚Äôll be on my laptop after hours of throwing together pages and pages of mood boards I will hardly use, still doing the same thing and mentally screaming at myself to stop and I can‚Äôt. I never do, until the very last minute where I‚Äôll have no other choice to.
I am self aware that this isn‚Äôt helping me, and yet every time in the moment I‚Äôll still subconsciously justify it by convincing myself ‚Äòat least I‚Äôm being productive rn, I‚Äôll move on to the next step soon."" (It‚Äôs never soon) Im so upset at myself because I know if I could actually manage my time I‚Äôd have have the time to get everything done that I need to and still enjoy things like spending time with people, making meals, getting enough sleep, etc. I have the time to make quality work, too. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt let myself do any of that. 

I‚Äôve pulled 5 all-nighters in the first 4 weeks. I‚Äôve already missed 3 classes and been 30 min late to 2. Again, I don‚Äôt hang out with friends, I hardly ever eat full meals, i don‚Äôt go to parties or bars or play video games or any of that. It feels like this is all I do and my work is never good and I‚Äôm just making myself miserable. I‚Äôm so upset at myself and I deeply regret the hours and hours I waste on a daily basis.

My entire college experience has been like this, except at some point I was actually motivated by a love for graphic design. At this point I just want it to be over. I‚Äôm so tired, I feel defeated. There‚Äôs no way this is even a viable career option for me if I can‚Äôt even balance my projects in college. 


Sorry if this seemed really dramatic, I didn‚Äôt sleep last night.

TLDR: I‚Äôm constantly struggling to move past the ‚Äòfirst step‚Äô of my university projects due to a lack of confidence and many negative mental associations that have built up over the years and it‚Äôs very discouraging and debilitating.",‚Äô kinda realizing glaring issue tremendously hinders time management schoollife balance general ‚Äô graphic design major first step every project like project extension research research subject matter connecting theme concept color pallet design style font choice paring design technique etc ‚Äô important part process come sketch executing chosen concept relevant min ‚Äô super competitive design program Two portfolio review process semester design class 40 400 end making hell ‚Äô senior year ‚Äô almost finished used really like graphic design passionate worked as make portfolio review think placed whole identity self worth ‚Äò dream career ‚Äô many anxiety attack mental breakdown portfolio review portion degree first 2 year ‚Äô worry passing review think mentally fight flight mode long brain still recovering something ‚Äô quite right Despite making review confidence shattered second guess every decision make Everyone around talented feel like fraud ‚Äô worked really hard get ‚Äô burnt barley function pretty strong negative association school class work Every single night assignment thing need present next class every single night cycle repeat research research research spend hour stuck gathering inspiration jotting concept ‚Äô afraid moving onto next step ‚Äô eat meal ‚Äô spend time friend ‚Äô even ‚Äò real ‚Äô work internal clock kick maybe around 3 morning class ‚Äô always rushed together ‚Äô never proud ‚Äô never proud work homework next day becomes even harder brain want move past research step Ever never feel ready loop constant cycle spending WAY much time meaningless first step neglecting important work feeling shitty ‚Äô laptop hour throwing together page page mood board hardly use still thing mentally screaming stop ‚Äô never last minute ‚Äô choice self aware ‚Äô helping yet every time moment ‚Äô still subconsciously justify convincing ‚Äò least ‚Äô productive rn ‚Äô move next step soon ‚Äô never soon Im upset know could actually manage time ‚Äô time get everything done need still enjoy thing like spending time people making meal getting enough sleep etc time make quality work ‚Äô like ‚Äô let ‚Äô pulled 5 allnighters first 4 week ‚Äô already missed 3 class 30 min late 2 ‚Äô hang friend hardly ever eat full meal ‚Äô go party bar play video game feel like work never good ‚Äô making miserable ‚Äô upset deeply regret hour hour waste daily basis entire college experience like except point actually motivated love graphic design point want ‚Äô tired feel defeated ‚Äô way even viable career option ‚Äô even balance project college Sorry seemed really dramatic ‚Äô sleep last night TLDR ‚Äô constantly struggling move past ‚Äò first step ‚Äô university project due lack confidence many negative mental association built year ‚Äô discouraging debilitating,anticipation

Now I've actually created my own company, surrounded myself in great people that all seem to think I'm some kind of genius, of which I am not, become financially successful (at least to some degree), kids are grown, marriage is stable, mental health is under control, and I've actually stuck with my current career for 10+ years. My work actually brings me joy. It also brings stress, bc it's work, but there is joy. But I'm also finding out that these feelings and fears I have are an actual thing with a name. At first that made me feel validated. I'm so glad that this sub exists and that the people here seem nice and supportive of each other. It's reassuring. It's also terrifying to know for sure that this isn't all in my head and I may be doomed to repeat this destructive cycle forever. I'm getting older. I can't keep destroying everything and rebuilding. I'm getting too old for it. Everyone understood when I was 20, a new parent, still finding myself. I know the fears are still there. I'm still terrified that I'm a complete fraud. I know that someday, any day now, people will realize that I never knew anything or even knew what I was doing as I trained others. Then those other people that I trained will have to explain themselves too. I know it's irrational, but I also know all too well how this story ends. I've been here many times before. Idk. I'm rambling now. 
I really just wanted to take a moment to say hello and thank all of you for being here and supporting one another.

3080,"Starting a new job in one week. I'm kind of nervous, because I didn't expect to get the offer, but I did. So I'm in my last week of my current job. I have no issues or problems with my job, I love the way things are run, the people, team I work with, and processes in place. 

However, another offer came to me, one that I did not think I was going to get, but interviewed for, just for experience. To my surprise, despite my experience of only three-months in my current role, they decided to offer me a promotion and job salary bump. I'm floored.

I trust their ability to suss if I'm the right candidate with the correct qualifications, but deep down, I also know I have bad anxiety. It's akin to them finding out I might not be whom I say I am.

I haven't had any reason to lie, and because I went in the interview with just honest interests and intentions to find out more information, I was genuine and only truthful about what I know and don't.

However, it is also the first time I'll be a senior and as well, manage a lower level report. They won't report directly to me, but be under my guidance and tutelage.

3082,"I (28F) grew up in extreme poverty. Like eating chocolate cake all month or PowerBars because it's what was what we had in our monthly food boxes. 
When I was 18 I got a job as a caregiver for a family member, had a child at 21 and when my family member passed when I was 22 I was out of work for a year. I dropped out of school and never got my GED so I wasn't able to get a job no matter where I applied. 

Eventually, things got so bad I went to DHS for help getting my life on track and they paid for me to get my GED and go to college for medical assisting. Somehow I passed with a 4.0 GPA and got the idea that I'd continue school to become a nurse instead. 3 years, a 3.89 GPA, 108 credits, and an associate in general studies later I finally got into nursing!

I somehow did it all by studying maybe 4 hours a week, if I write what I'm studying with pencil and paper in my own words/understanding, I pretty much have the subject memorized and get between 85% - 99% on my tests.

The problem is that I'm not like everyone else, they have successful parents, and nobody has ever even played a video game or watched anime before. I try to talk about my likes and I get a dead eyed stare from a room of people that I have nothing in common with. I feel like I'm balancing on a house of cards and everyone is going to realize that I'm not smart and counting on my memorization abilities, and that I don't actually fit in.

3088,"So my understanding of imposter syndrome is pretty limited but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve developed it.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I‚Äôve done good.

And then I didn‚Äôt do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master‚Äôs program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It‚Äôs always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

3090,"Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this forum. I basically wanted to vent some stuff I've had on my mind the past weekend. So, I graduated recently with my bachelor's in statistics in early May, and I have been job hunting since then until literally a few days ago. I managed to finally get what I would have considered my ""dream job"", a data analyst position at a big company with great benefits and a fantastic starting salary. I truly couldn't believe it when I got the call back that I had finally gotten the job offer after having interviewed countless times and even being rejected once from another company I really wanted to work with.

Now, I struggle with incredibly low self-esteem in general. Although I graduated with the top of my class and had a near 4.0 grade point average, I still considered myself less than adequate for one reason: I had very little relevant work experience. I knew some programming languages sure as was required by my school coursework, but because I was a commuter student I wasn't involved in any fancy professional clubs/orgs, I had no internships in the field to speak of, and when I originally graduated, I was terrified I'd end up in a terrible job I didn't want doing something I was going to be bad at because all I really know how to do was study hard, learn really hard math, and get good grades.

I was and still am shocked as hell I managed to actually get my foot in the door as an official business analyst doing what I had originally went to college to do. But I feel like that initial anxiety I had still hasn't gone away. Now, I'm worried about basically ""fucking it up"". I didn't lie to them about knowing technologies I didn't know, it was obvious from my resume and the stories I chose to tell to them during my interviews that I had no internship experience and was basically a brand new freshie.

I basically just tried to convince them that I knew how to analyze datasets and math and could communicate difficult concepts to people. Which, honestly, I believe I can do. But at the same time, I'm not an expert by any means in any of the softwares I have used. In college, when given the choice to do something with software or by hand, I almost always did it by hand because I just preferred that, and I learned better doing that.

So I guess basically I'm wondering if what I'm going through is the dreaded imposter syndrome I've always heard about in fields such as these. I always felt deep down that I wasn't good enough, and I was shocked anyone decided to give me a chance at all. Part of me wants to tell myself that if they thought I wasn't going to be able to do the job, they wouldn't have hired me. I was a first-generation college student, no one has ever done a job like I'm doing in my family, and I literally have no frame of reference. I feel like I'm in undiscovered territory, and I have no idea what my first day is going to be like and what my manager is going to expect from me for the first few weeks. I just don't want to let anybody down, and I want to be what I have to be. What should I do?",Hi first time Ive posted forum basically wanted vent stuff Ive mind past weekend graduated recently bachelor statistic early May job hunting since literally day ago managed finally get would considered dream job data analyst position big company great benefit fantastic starting salary truly couldnt believe got call back finally gotten job offer interviewed countless time even rejected another company really wanted work struggle incredibly low selfesteem general Although graduated top class near 40 grade point average still considered le adequate one reason little relevant work experience knew programming language sure required school coursework commuter student wasnt involved fancy professional clubsorgs internship field speak originally graduated terrified Id end terrible job didnt want something going bad really know study hard learn really hard math get good grade still shocked hell managed actually get foot door official business analyst originally went college feel like initial anxiety still hasnt gone away Im worried basically fucking didnt lie knowing technology didnt know obvious resume story chose tell interview internship experience basically brand new freshie basically tried convince knew analyze datasets math could communicate difficult concept people honestly believe time Im expert mean software used college given choice something software hand almost always hand preferred learned better guess basically Im wondering Im going dreaded imposter syndrome Ive always heard field always felt deep wasnt good enough shocked anyone decided give chance Part want tell thought wasnt going able job wouldnt hired firstgeneration college student one ever done job like Im family literally frame reference feel like Im undiscovered territory idea first day going like manager going expect first week dont want let anybody want,trust

3097,"So last week I was losing my mind.  I've been negotiating with this potential vendor, and we had a meeting and afterward I didn't hear from them for a few days.  So I'm like, 'look how much of a fuckup I am, that I can't even entice vendors', I was convinced that I'd sounded like an asshat, not knowing what I was talking about.  At the same time, I got pissy with a customer because they were asking about a bunch of asinine stuff, so then I spent two days convinced I was going to get fired for pissing off a customer.  And add to it, my mentor asked how I was doing, and I wrote back this 'fear of failure' thing, and then didn't hear back from him...

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.  And my mentor made this long apology about how he should be doing better by me if I feel like a failure, that he loves working with me, etc.

It's all just so tough to believe sometimes...  I'm totally convinced I should be a janitor, that I'm not worth a damn to this company I've been a manager at for nearly twenty years.

It was hot and the cap and gown were both black and I am visibly sweating.

I wanted to take some memos my students wrote on teacher appreciation day at my school and put them on my cap. Five separate students wrote a positive message about how nice I am in class.

3104,"So I just started a new job a week ago in a consulting firm and I feel so underqualified for this role. I got accepted into a well-known firm which is quite surprising because they require experience in the JD. For some unknown reason, I got in even if I only had 1 interview with the senior manager (Typically they have 2 or multiple interview steps). Other than that, adjusting to a new country with a different culture makes it more difficult for me. 

Every day I always have negative thoughts in my head and it's affecting my mental health :(. I wish I can afford therapy but I was unemployed for a while before getting this job so that's out of the question for now.

So I started a new job about 7 weeks ago, it is a complete change of scenery and a male dominated industry but I do enjoy it.
My ex helped me with getting an interview as he knew the SSM who hires the employees.
I still went through the application and interview process but it was definitely more lenient for me.
And although I feel like I have proved myself capable and that I want to pursue a higher career in this industry, I still can‚Äôt help but think because I had help that I do not deserve it.

I have also found out my colleagues have sent a recommendation email to the SSM about me, which helps.
But the doubt is always there, plus my ex has now started using it against me in certain situations.

3108,"Okay so,  the title says it all basically.  I have struggled with IS for years, and generally end up internalizing it.  Mostly due to syndrome making me believe that I am just a whiny baby, not someone with an actual problem worth taking up time, money, and resources to fix.  

This internalizing has lead to countless occasions of hurting the people closest to me because of viewing the world from my skewed perspective as well as sabotaging myself and having to start over in life constantly.

So when the old feeling starting creeping up that I‚Äôm not a productive contributor to any facet of life I am in, I decided to speak up for once.

3111,"Hi community. My first post in this community and I am curious about how Imposter Syndrome shows not only in your life but also specifically in relationships. 

About me: I am 37, almost 38, first and foremost a musician who has struggled with performance anxiety and always trying to give my best but then always end up thinking it wasn‚Äôt good enough, or that there‚Äôs someone better than me. Add in having parents who constantly asked why I wasn‚Äôt doing well in college and subsequently thinking they are always judging my every move in life. 

But I think most notably I struggle with my Imposter Syndrome surfacing in my relationships. I am gay and have had a couple significant relationships in my life, my last one being 7 years with someone who I viewed as more successful than me, smarter, etc. I am now entering a new relationship with a very creative person (who has admitted his own struggles with Imposter) but who has that ability to be confident, and show his self so strongly. As this relationship is going I find myself thinking thoughts that tear down every facet of hope in this relationship. And I am madly and deeply in love more and more every day.  Like, ‚Äúwhat does this guy want with you, you don‚Äôt talk strong like he does, you don‚Äôt have strong opinions, you‚Äôre not good enough for him, if he really gets to know you he won‚Äôt like you, one day he will meet someone else that is better than you‚Äù

3112,"I just finished my second semester of online grad school for counseling and it was ROUGH. I took Counseling Techniques this semester and we do recording assignments to show our proficiency of skills. I did okay throughout the semester, but on the last assignment, I tanked. The Professor said that the assignment I submitted does not show the required level of competency in these skills. I have a passing grade in the class, but I wouldn't be surprised if I am still forced to retake it. 

I feel upset and stupid. I've had these feelings pop up throughout my two semesters. Also, in other classes, where I felt like I didn't belong. I want this career. I want to be a therapist, but maybe I do not have what it takes to be one. There are some things that you can learn and change within yourself and there are some things that you just can't. I'm not sure if this is something that I can change. 

Like the title says, I'm not sure if this is imposter Syndrome from seeing a reflection of my fear of failing, or a wake-up call that I'm not meant or cut out for this work. I even considered other possible career options in different directions. 

At this point, I am frustrated, upset, and concerned about my future. I also feel stupid if I ended up wasting my time and money not only in this grad school but also in my undergrad. I love psychology and will advocate for mental health always, but I'm starting to think that that is not enough. That loving the subject and dreaming about a career in that field is not enough. I'm starting to think that I chose the wrong career path and now I am stuck. I'm starting to wish for a redo on life to make sure that I pick right this time. 

I also think that COVID had a heavy hand with this. Before COVID, I was very motivated and ready to go, but lately, with the way that the world is, I'm not sure why I was so motivated. Or for what?

3115,"This is my first post here. I'm sorry if I break any rules.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone. Even though I know that I suffer from imposter syndrome, (I'm in therapy for this and other reasons), I TRUELY believe that what I'm doing is bad and that I am stupid. People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

3123,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I‚Äôm in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

‚ÄúYou went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won‚Äôt make enough because of it to make that ok‚Äù

It‚Äôs the answer to the last one that makes me realize I‚Äôve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I‚Äôve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I‚Äôm a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn‚Äôt know I just couldn‚Äôt hack it academically, even though I‚Äôve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn‚Äôt worked, it‚Äôs because those around me wouldn‚Äôt let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fianc√© before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù and snap everyone around me out of it.

3128,"In finite games (or games where there is a goal, a winner and a loser, and set boundaries), the prize is a title (whether that is being a gold medalist, getting a promotion, or being a degree holder). This is in contrast of infinite games, where there are no winners, and the point of the game is to keep the game going (for example, the game of literature, the game of science, and the game of music). 

Imposter Syndrome typically occurs to me, and maybe some of you, in school or at work (both in which are finite games). The titles that we earn in finite games are titles symbolizing the accomplishments of the past. Having a Harvard degree symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Becoming a director symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Getting a gold medal symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. These titles are not about the present, but the past! These titles are a form of credit that tells the world that we did well in the past; the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Possibly, anxiety from Imposter Syndrome comes from having the titles but being unsure about our capacity to hold up to the expectations of these titles.

How does one hold up to the expectations of these titles? One possibility is to do well enough... in which you later get another title. And then the cycle repeats itself. You can have your high school degree, your bachelors, your masters, and you can be part of the C-suite, and still have Imposter Syndrome. 

My proposed solution, and I know it's easier said than done, is to let go of the expectations and trust that we've been appropriately given the title. There is no way that *all* these people, institutions, and systems were wrong. Since part of the anxiety is not meeting expectations, another thing that can be done is focusing on the present and do the best we can - the chances are that we can meet expectations. After all, it's a game and we've been beating level after level - we're literally where we are supposed to be.",finite game game goal winner loser set boundary prize title whether gold medalist getting promotion degree holder contrast infinite game winner point game keep game going example game literature game science game music Imposter Syndrome typically occurs maybe school work finite game title earn finite game title symbolizing accomplishment past Harvard degree symbolizes well enough past Becoming director symbolizes well enough past Getting gold medal symbolizes well enough past title present past title form credit tell world well past best predictor future behavior past behavior Possibly anxiety Imposter Syndrome come title unsure capacity hold expectation title one hold expectation title One possibility well enough later get another title cycle repeat high school degree bachelor master part Csuite still Imposter Syndrome proposed solution know easier said done let go expectation trust weve appropriately given title way people institution system wrong Since part anxiety meeting expectation another thing done focusing present best chance meet expectation game weve beating level level literally supposed,trust

3146,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

3164,"If you are like me, remote work can be pretty stressful if you suffer from this syndrome. I have got the best possible job for a young guy like me, I can't complain at all, either of my boss, supervisors and co-workers.

While I was at the office before this pandemic, I had these thoughts that maybe I am not good enough for the job requirements but they were not so active because my co-workers are great and my boss keeps having great conversations with us which makes me feel comfortable at work. Now, by working remotely, conversations with other co-workers are not so frequent and that makes me think everybody is working harder than I am. 

I also had this feeling that my supervisors are constantly looking at the chat to spot if I am online or not and whenever I did a break, I felt guilty and I tried to be back at work as soon as possible because my brain kept telling me ""Your boss probably has already called several times and you are here....having lunch.....pffff, you really do not deserve this job"". 

Well, once I started to ignore these thoughts and take my time to have lunch or to have a conversation with my family, I felt much better. Not only because when I got back to work I had no message or call asking for my assistance but also because I understood that whenever I sent a message to someone at the company, they would take their time to answer and I would think that maybe they are too busy to answer me at the moment....so why shouldn't they think the same about me if I take some time to answer as well?

Let me start by saying I believe I've had imposter syndrome for as long as I can remember (going back to elementary school and believing I was not at the same level as my school peers).

&#x200B;

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job. I've been working on my resume (obsessing mostly), trying to perfect it, sell myself as best I can without over-selling. My father says I need to just start applying but I am just so anxious that any job I get with some responsibility, I'll end up failing.

&#x200B;

I do suffer from anxiety and OCD, so I'm basically always already doubting myself. The thing is, through experience, I tend to overthink situations. I have for as long as I can remember. But in the end, things that I've overthought tend to not be as scary as I've made them in my mind.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

3181,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",Hello first post Im wondering belongs Going back rough childhood always felt like havent really anything get lot youth Ive felt like didnt really anything belong worked moving past However barely adult 18 started journey feel day faking dont belong started work chain coffee shop ended dating one coworkers dating ended quitting started work food truck odds end able get shift working job brake good term stood friend continued help already met family still really good term well went different direction completely changed life dont want give many detail privacy reason basically Grandma working contractor client needed full time accountant daughter also worked client full time employee two running basically financial aspect swamped needed help Im fresh high school working first semester college reach guess GM started accounting really young dad taught daughter around 15 ish GM knew client wanted someone experience help didnt want pay said experience GM also bad experience college grad thought knew everything didnt listen direction GM interviewed basically said look saw work EXBF know hard worker opportunity pretend experience highschool etc would teach everything needed know True word GM amazing taught almost everything know amazing human helped treated like family entire time Unfortunately client wasnt best left GM actually vouched going back Highschool taught worked 2 different position accounting paper experience real life experience give take year 18 Ive field year found lot people field havent gone school life experience thing going back first extended offer long even opportunity felt wrong Like lying amazing family accepting didnt feel right reason Im forever grateful still contact haunted somehow lied cheated way life got accepted first lease boyfriend got key last week Im paying car able buy feel way range two pet pretty good place would like think feel wrong like didnt anything get Like someone going figure lied get dont know Im Im fake took job people work get,trust

3183,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them. Sorry this is so long, most of you probably won't even get to the end but my point is: is the way I felt about being called a hero imposter syndrome?",context used house directly across street workplace work gas station old man lived sister would regularly come store help couple minor chore like taking trash really enjoyed helping think needed thing occupy time gave much free food drink wanted basically sweet old man store street corner house street corner right across u really shitty intersection people often run red light cut parking lot going way fast old man fruit stand front portion house porch would hit car time year one night month ago dude crashed directly house old man bedroom thankfully wasnt part way living room shattered main support beam house inside time coworker heard loud crash went outside see happened saw truck started freaking rushed see old man ok dug rubble trying get old man passed truck ended unburying driver door couldnt get farther checked dude hurt said shoulder hurt lot bleeding conscious seemed pain mostly ok left paramedic look arrived went around side truck find way heard old man calling broke door probably shouldnt house wasnt exactly stable started calling name could find wasnt buried whole lot debris couple wall worth stuff completely hidden view use voice find exactly uncover pull Later night coworker called hero next day another coworker thing next day also reporter going interviewing old man wanted know got assume interview well tried point shook head said wasnt turned walked away made extremely uncomfortable especially people calling hero face wasnt feeling modesty like oh anyone would would call positive emotion Like thank nice Im hero like aversion called negative emotion like absolutely dont call dont deserve called havent told anyone wife people store coworkers regular customer know people talk rural community didnt tell Sorry long probably wont even get end point way felt called hero imposter syndrome,anticipation

3187,"So my fianc√© is probably one of the hardest workers I‚Äôve ever seen. She has been promoted multiple times, recognized by higher-ups, complements galore, etc., yet she still doubts herself. Heavily...

The most recent example was that her company laid off her entire team (8 people), but kept her because, well...she‚Äôs awesome! This morning she was telling me that she‚Äôs basically not good enough for this role among other thing. She was also perturbed that some of the district managers that she worked with previously have not wished her good luck with the new role. And it irritates her.This was after many, many, other people complimenting/congratulating her.

She is finally seeing a therapist and her therapist diagnosed her with IS. I am diagnosed OCD and I know I do things that annoy her, but she does whatever she can to help me, so how can I help her? 

I get so frustrated that she‚Äôs verbally harming herself when it comes to her job and other things she does (like decorating the house). I tell her genuinely that I think she is amazing and I just kind of get to a boiling point where I don‚Äôt know what to do and we start arguing. Please help!

She thinks she will get fired sometimes to, but they keep promoting her lol. I‚Äôm just so proud of her! And she has such a big heart for an aggressive hard worker too!

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly.

(poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

Also last night going to bed I had the thought, ""I can't believe I'm not homeless"". A huge part of my imposter syndrome rn is being mostly financially dependent on my mom and not having financial independence yet.

I've somehow managed to build this reputation of being a confident, self-assured, sociable guy but inside I feel like I'm really not.

But somehow, on the outside that doesn't come across. So I start getting treated as a person that I really am not. At times it can make me very uncomfortable and I'm subjected to expectations that I am not able to meet.

3203,"On a different Reddit group reframing came up and I wanted to share. Hopefully, it will add some value to someone. 

One of my professors in school would have me do reframing techniques and keeping a diary. It was a way for me to stop doubting myself so much, realize what I've accomplished and the value I've created.  The process reframed how I looked at some situations and how I looked at myself. 

I recently did this in a roundabout way. I hired someone to do a bio, career history for me for a professional reason. I couldn't see all that I had accomplished myself and was struggling to see myself beyond the tasks I had carried out. As I was working with this person and the questions they asked I realized I needed to reframe again because I had lost sight of my value and validity.

Reframing is a technique that can help us refocus our feelings of inadequacy and create a balanced mental model of how we perceive ourselves or situations. Below is a link to an online interactive app that allows you to reframe.  

Use this to realize failure is a learning opportunity and reaffirm your success, validity, accomplishments, contributions and value. Also if you have other ideas you want a different perspective on this tool can help. I don't know who created it I was just looking for a reframing worksheet and found this instead.

3205,"I am a person with pretty serious anxiety, depression, ADHD and imposter syndrome of some sort. Usually my symptoms/behavior are pretty manageable. But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.
* The usual imposter stuff--""everyone at work finds me annoying/doesn't want to work with me, I don't belong there,"" etc. etc. etc.

Does anyone have resources, techniques or methods to help deal with these delusions?

3209,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me ‚Äúthere were people who did not want to employ you‚Äù and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either ‚ÄúI think you are an idiot‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are now fired‚Äù. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...‚Äù. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn‚Äôt 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It‚Äôs silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don‚Äôt remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager‚Äôs manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I‚Äôve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it‚Äôs ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10.

Last night I met my SO's parents. They're well-to-do: Wealthy, accomplished, connected - the whole bit.   
They were completely warm and welcoming and the evening was fine. 

Although they are not in the least bit pretentious and did nothing to elicit these feelings, I left feeling inadequate and ashamed. I left feeling small. 

I am smart and have a career trajectory that I know people find impressive. In theory, I belong. But even so, I felt so much less than them. Honestly, afterward, I wanted to curl up into a ball. 

It's hard to divorce the person you are today from where or how you grew up. 

No amount of wealth or success seems to alter that internal, mental image of yourself as that kid from that not-so-great family. 

As I spend more and more of my personal and professional time with increasingly affluent, privileged people, I come to realize all that I didn't have growing up. It comes in waves, all things I do not know. Sometimes it's the small things (a butter keeper - what's that?) and sometimes it's the larger things, all the social norms of the classes above me that I'm still learning. 

I worry I stick out like a sore thumb. I worry I'm not worth the same as these other people. But then what is the worth of a human life? I know it's more than butter keepers and Ivy League educations.

3241,"My tutoring company has been doing remote work due to COVID, and they are starting to look into some in-person tutoring, given that both the client and tutor are comfortable. I have the option of being an in-person tutor again, in which I get paid a little more. I'm not personally scared of COVID from tutoring, so I am considering it. I worry though about being a good enough tutor. And so far the two students I've had who switched tutors‚ÄîI'm assuming because they didn't like me‚Äîwere ones I went to see in person, as opposed to in the office or remote. 

If I may vent, I was academically successful until college, at which point, I got by. I mean, I went to a prestigious STEM school and graduated in good standing with a BS in CS-Math. I think I got honors in CS. And I love helping people, tutored on-campus, and even tutored young kids over the phone. So I'm capable.

However, I'm not confident. And I don't do well under pressure. Like once I was doing an interview, I was asked to calculate the value of 5/8 without a calculator. I said 1.6 or something. At which point, the interviewer guided me to the realization that 5/8 is less than 1, so how is 1.6 reasonable?

I've had my tutoring job for less than a year. But I have been in it for over half a year, so I think I'm past the ""oh, you're new, mistakes happen"" phase. I believe I have the foundational knowledge I need, but I don't think I have the... sufficient knowledge that other tutors seem to have to confidently answer any kid's question. I find myself often saying that I need to get back to a kid on that. I don't know all the answers, despite having resources, answer keys, and time to plan. Nor am I motivated to give even more time to learning as I have already. 

So I feel like an imposter. Either because I am less competent than my fellow tutors or because I don't want to put in the effort I'd need to be as competent as them. 

Yesterday, I had one remote lesson to teach in the evening. All day I'd been anxious about it. It wasn't horrible anxiety, but it was present. And the lesson was fine. I expected it to be fine. But I still felt scared. 

I feel like an imposter. And I don't like it. But this tutoring job is so flexible and has such a respectful community, that I don't think I should give it up. If something feels wrong, I figure I must be at fault. 

tl;dr I do feel like an imposter. I think I just wanted to vent.

3250,"New here. I work in film and theatre, or at least I'm trying to get into that industry as an actor/screenwriter/director. I like to do more than one thing. It's the sort of career where you learn on the job by speaking to other people and working with them. In short, you need to network like a fox. But I can't ask for help. If I did, I would be too terrified to be ridiculed and torn down because it's so obvious that I don't know what I'm doing and I would be exposed as a fraud, a pathetic laughing stock and a failure. But I need to ask for help to learn the skills to do my job. It's a vicious cycle. I grew up in the care system surrounded by narcissistic people and jaded social workers who just wanted to end the conversation and go home for their dinner instead of giving a shit about you or their job. Their favourite word was ""no"". Aiming to achieve anything other than working in a minimum wage job and living in a crap one bedroom flat was discouraged. So I had to go into every single meeting with them every 6-8 weeks feeling armed to the teeth for battle and it was exhausting. If I wanted or needed something I would have to plan an entire TEDx talk to get through it and if they found one single area in my idea that wasn't quite developed yet, they would be like ""AHA!"", and jump right in there to tear me down and keep me under their boot. I was constantly reminded of how I was a stupid little girl living in a fantasy world and had no idea what I was doing or what reality was. They would straight up make fun of you. But they never taught me anything to help me with normal life either because they want you to stay helpless and rely on the system, and then judged me for not having a clue how to do simple things despite it being their responsibility to teach you. You weren't allowed to do anything for yourself (and there were often consequences when you tried to) and then at a certain age, they expected you to just magically be able to do it. So now if I want to do anything at all, even the simplest of things like asking someone how I write a script, I can't. I'm too afraid that the rest of the world is exactly like them. I don't want them to laugh at me if I want to make films and have no idea where to start. If I try to overwhelm myself by doing everything, I fail.

But as the week progresses, my self doubt grows bit by bit and suddenly I‚Äôm overwhelmed and I‚Äôm not able to do my actual job properly. Sometimes in team meetings, I will go without saying even a single word in fear of being found out that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. 

I normally do competitive programming challenges with my friends. 90% of the time I will be able to solve the problem which they are not able to. But my confidence level is not even 10% of what they have. This self doubt creeps in when I do anything new. Like buying a new bike. I literally thought I will make some accident during my first ride. 

When I read about imposter syndrome in Internet, it says that it is common among high achievers. That makes me feel good for a while. But after that, my only feeling is that I cannot handle this job and just want to quit and go to some remote location.

3252,"Has anyone every feel like they are never good enough no matter how hard you try? and then because you feel like you are not good enough, you kind of stop trying or almost don't really care about the consequences of your actions? For example, you were enthusiastic about starting a new job and so far things are going good.. then you make a few mistakes but that is okay because you are new and your job is normally difficult no matter who is in it...so you try again.. and then a few more little mistakes then maybe a slightly bigger mistake but you were helped and guided by your colleagues. Seems normal right? it's not like they are pressuring you, if anything encouraging you and helping you solve through problems.. and then you start questioning your ability to do your job, thinking about how much help you need. When realizing how much help you need or in my terms ""hand holding"", you definitely start feeling you are not smart enough and why do I need so much help... and do I even make sense when I ask questions?

3253,"A quick note - I only discovered information about imposter syndrome within the past 24 hours and I feel like I have really discovered what has been happening to me most of my life. 

&nbsp;


Last year I was offered a Leadership/Management Internship position at Walt Disney World - something that I have worked towards since my high school grad in 2011! I was placed into housekeeping leadership though I had no prior experience in it (all my leadership experience was front desk or merchandise) so I felt like I was thrown into unfamiliar territory. 


&nbsp;


I was there for about 6 months (internship was for 1 year and a potential permanent position was available at the end of it), assisted in opening a new resort, and about 3 months in I began to have extreme anxiety attacks at work - I would lock myself in my office and cry and have trouble catching my breath. The role as a leader wasn‚Äôt difficult per se, the role itself was something that I could do on a day to day basis. I told my parents and my s/o that I was out-of-place, that I missed guest interaction (there was little to no daily guest interaction unless there was a guest to apologize to), and that I felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in.


&nbsp;


Whereas those were all the truth, I feel like I didn‚Äôt tell them the full truth. I am extremely terrified of failing and letting people down. I felt like in a position of leadership at this level, I had so much daily weight put on me and I was scared I would fail (even though I had only received praise from my peers and those above me). Eventually I was struggling to get out of bed for what was meant to be my ‚Äúdream job‚Äù, or at least the start of it. I began to question what I wanted to for so long. I left that position and took a general merchandiser position (non-leadership) within the parks and now I feel so unfulfilled but worried to try to step into a leadership position. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm looking for...advice or validation? I‚Äôm terrified of applying for another leadership position in fear that this will happen again..I have no idea.

3254,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

3255,"I guess I just need to get this out and see if this mirrors anyone else's experience.

Or if I'm just completely out of my mind.

My therapist definitely believes I have impostor syndrome. This is based on some information I explained to him. In my classes (senior in college), for example, I received an A on both term papers for both courses last term, a 97% and a 98%. And I am still waiting for the grade to be lowered because SURELY these professionals have to figure out that it's all fraudulent. The school I go to uses turn it in and I am able to see my results, both had low %s meaning the content was original, yet I'm still convinced somehow I must've cheated on the assignments. Logically, I know I did not, I remember the painstaking and grueling hours reading the research, putting them together and writing it out in the APA format. I also did well on the quizzes. I can't fathom that I have gotten those grades on my own but I know, logically, I did.

I am also a community activist locally. I don't do anything major or impressive--but it requires me to confront politicians and community leaders with a ton of stats and facts. I am known for my skills in researching and strategy on these topics. I am by no means a mastermind. But I am often able to cite case studies and statistics --yet, even though I've done the hours of research, written them down into an essay, presented them and even have had them double checked, I constantly have to re-check the information before speaking on them again, as I am convinced I have them wrong or made them up. 

This all sounds like impostor syndrome to me--but the part that I never hear about it and I wonder if anyone else deals with this or if its a totally different ""syndrome"". I don't just expect to exposed as a fraud, I expect to be exposed as a horrible human being. I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, most of which I've at least made an effort to atone for, but I am constantly waiting for my ""horrid actions"" to bd exposed--and often times, they are imagined actions or they are based on real events but ""modified"".

One example and I know this sounds strange: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up 3 years ago (almost). And it was a nasty fight, I was crude and petty. The relationship NEEDED to end. I regret how I ended it. But we made amends for both of our wrongdoings throughout the relationship and while we've maintained a healthy emotional distance since then, when we see each other (pre-COVID) we say hi, we've had some small social media interactions and we've even discussed the end of our relationship. In fact, we respect each other very much and the relationship. Yet, nonsensically, I've ""imagined"" him ""exposing"" me as this horrid person who destroyed his life. I know that's not going to happen and it's not true--but it has become to the point that I actually thought I was going to lose all my friends and my standing in my community over it. But there's no actual basis for this. 

I also am frequently expecting the law to come to me and ""catch me"" for the horrible crimes I've committed. I fear being caught, but not for anything I've done, but rather, that I'll be ""planted"" and charged. Now, I am a community activist but not high level enough to worry about that happening.

All of this is based on non-sense. And I have not been diagnosed with anything like psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't have auditory or visual hallucinations. But I am constantly surrounded by guilt and feelings of inadequacy, which I believe is beyond the average persons standard of self-doubt and insecurity.

Thank you for letting me share and I know I sound ""crazy"". If you have any advice or resources, or similar stories (even if you would prefer to share them in a private message), I'm here to listen.

3256,"i think ive always dealt with this feeling, for my entire first year at a good university, i felt like i wasnt smart enough to be there and that I go into the university on luck.

I ended this year with 3.9 gpa and try to tell myself that this is proof that i belong at this uni, but immediately after i say that, i think that i only got this gpa on luck. i only got this gpa because im not a stem major and i spend most of my time on getting good grades so its not an accomplishment

a few days ago, i got accepted for a research assistant position with one of my professors. i havent been able to have a stable emotion for 5 minutes straight and feel that at any moment the prof will tell me that the email was a mistake or that she wants to fire me. im so scared to start research because im terrified that she will realize i am not as smart as my gpa shows and will despise me. i know people much smarter and accomplished than me who applied for this position and didnt get it. i dont know why i got it, it feels like some kind of sick joke- it feels like a dream or a nightmare. ive never had any research experience before this, ive literally worked only part time jobs rolling burritos or lifeguarding in order to help my family.

3258,"I‚Äôve had IS for quite some time and it‚Äôs ruined my ability to form relationships with people who just want to support me. I can‚Äôt take a compliment or accept their praise and they get frustrated, even verbally angry at me for not ‚Äúunderstanding my worth‚Äù. This has lead to tension between my mother and I because she always wanted to uplift me and I felt guilty, as she was wasting time and energy on me. I then feel guilty that I‚Äôm rejecting love and support when there are a lot of people who are not fortunate enough to have a mother so loving. It‚Äôs sends me in a spiral, further enforcing my belief that I don‚Äôt deserve anything good, I was just lucky enough to be given a mom like her.

She passed away 7 months ago. I never got to tell her how grateful I am to have her constant support while I was struggling, (with mental illness and sobriety). I miss her more than words can describe.

One thing I hate is people telling me that I‚Äôm doing surprisingly well dealing with her death, which I take as a back handed compliment. Shouldn‚Äôt I be grieving more dramatically because she was so important to me? Why am I happy sometimes even though she‚Äôs gone? Are people expecting me to relapse because of the tragedy? How can people say that they admire my bravery and strength to carry on, especially when I spend hours stuck in the past, trying to remember her?

I feel like I‚Äôm only ‚Äúdoing surprisingly well‚Äù because I have shoved everything down and I am not working hard enough in therapy to address my grief, I‚Äôm only repeating what I‚Äôve read in books or posts of what the stages of dealing with grief look and sound like. I lie about my feelings to everyone, even my therapist. My therapist praises me for not relapsing into self destructing habits, but I feel like I haven‚Äôt fallen back on those because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint my mom, even though she is no longer here. The idea that I‚Äôm ‚Äústrong‚Äù is scary to me. I feel like these compliments create so much doubt in my head, causing me to relapse because that is what is expected of me. 

Through all of this, I don‚Äôt have my mom‚Äôs unconditional support to fall back on when I feel my life is a sham, I don‚Äôt have that one person who loves me no matter who I think or pretend I am. It‚Äôs tricky navigating my thoughts and feelings alone and I feel like I‚Äôve been killing myself looking for reassurance from other sources, like my work or social media, so much so that I have neglected working on my relationships with my family, who is hurting too. I don‚Äôt want to let them down the same way I let my mom down so many times, nor do I want to have them worry about me, or spend time and energy trying to support me as I will never truly feel validated. They should just continue believing I am ‚Äúdoing surprisingly well‚Äù even though I know I am faking it.

I am a medical student in the US and imposter syndrome hit me hard when I first started medical school - someone people have told me that it never really goes away so I should just find a way to deal with it through various wellness practices. 

While I still feel it now, a couple years ago I was overworking myself to the point where I was not eating all day until 8-9PM, not taking breaks, and not being social so I wanted to write a post for anyone who can relate to my experience. It took me a long time to acknowledge that I have imposter syndrome and that's totally okay, but because I realized that now I try as much as I can to not let it dictate my life. 

If you are all interested, I write more about my experiences in my blog (I have a lot of down time right now because all of our clinical work is suspended).

I am super successful in my field but I truly believe thats a combination of luck, a lack of close supervision and the fact I have learnt to make people trust me and talk with conviction so no one realises that I don't know what I am doing and I'm not very good at it either.

My logical brain knows this can't be true, even the best blaggers can only run on luck for so long. But whenever I'm around someone who has more experience than me I realise how much I am winging it.

I do have some professional qualifications. I have been contracting for 2 years and in this time I've been renewed on multiple occasions and recommended. But the longer it goes on the worse my imposter syndrome is getting. Im constantly afraid I'm going to be found out and sacked and that i will never find a job on the same level or even any more than a supervisor (I've been a D-level executive of a big business and now run my own project management business). I am convinced all I'm good at is being a junior manager or less.

I feel the higher I get in my career the worse this gets. And its crippling me.

3301,"I have recently finished my masters in robotics.

But at the end of defense, he told he was disappointed and told me what the actual goal is and since I didnt prove that, instead I did something else, he gave me a really bad grade there by dragging my entire masters Aggregate down.

3308,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

3316,"What's the psychology behind Imposter Syndrome?

If I were to reply that question based on my experience with imposter syndrome, I'll say it's because I expect people to acknowledge my capabilities the way I imagine I'd have done it to someone else. But how often do I compliment someone else irl? It's quite rare that I pat on a friend or a relative's back to celebrate their accomplishments. This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.

I feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions. This is why this sort of compliments feel diluted like it's not meaningful enough to digest as truthful.

However, in real life, I work as a software developer and whenever my boss or the seniors compliment me (which rarely happens) on something I did, suddenly all of that worries instantly go away but unfortunately, it's only temporary. I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.

A potential cure?

I think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us. For me, those people are my parents, my brother, my boss, the seniors at work and a couple of colleagues in my rank. I believe that if one wants their imposter syndrome to completely go away, they're gonna have to maximise the amount of compliments they want to generate from these meaningful people. The compliment may not be physically expressed but it could also be subtle as in an increase in the respect people have for you.

In order to please those people, you're gonna have to 'git gud' in life. Work on yourself constantly, keep improving yourself. Always be active. Always ask for something to do. Try to work on the bank of knowledge of your department if you work in software. During my spare time, not only do I browse Reddit but I have tabs of research materials open. I gather knowledge which my team will need in the future and I present them during meeting.

Work your way up the hierarchy of competence and you'll notice your imposter syndrome will slowly fade away. The way people will look at you will be different. They will smile at you. They will be happy to work with you and to me, that's the one effective way to combat against that horrible, horrible thing called imposter syndrome.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it.

The longer I spend applying for jobs and not hearing anything back, the worse I feel, because there's obviously a reason why nobody's responding to my applications.

I just feel like I've been given a good degree for lying about being smart and that now I'm not going to be able to use it and I just spent ¬£27k on something I'm going to have on my wall whilst I work in a supermarket because I can't get a job anywhere else. I just want a job so I can afford to move out with my boyfriend.

3342,"idk if this is the place for this.   like trying to get into a new thing, a new franchise.  actually, pretty much anything ive been a part of i often feel like im not a 'true fan'.   so for example, something old that i liked since i was a kid was pokemon.  i started out with the first games, RBY.    i dont really feel like an imposter for liking pokemon, but sometimes i still do.  but even moreso is something like street figther.  i never played traditional fighting games until a few years ago, with Street Fighter V.   i really want to like it, but i feel like such idk, an outsider? a fake? both.   i wasnt a part of the community that followed the games from the originals.   i like the storyline, the lore, but since i wasnt a part of it from the beginning, i feel detached from it somehow.  like its not a part of me and never will be.  whereas pokemon, its practically part of my identity (maybe thats a bad thing too, basing myself off of external things, trying to see myself in characters and not seeing the characters as separate entities from myself, but i have always struggled with knowing myself in general).     


but its just especially prevalent with new things. i cant get into things easily.  i constantly think about the people who know more, have been around longer, are better at the videogames, what have you.   makes me feel like trying to find ""my"" thing, but i dont have a thing.   ""jack of all trades, master of none, better than a master of one"", but that doesnt feel true. i wish i was really good at one thing.  i feel im straying from my original issue, but well, its that i cant commit to anything.  my passions are flimsy, i never feel completely immersed in anything--instrument, music, movies, drawing, videogames, skilltoys; i do all these different things but i never completely can give myself permission to just enjoy something fully.  i always feel sortof detached no matter what i do--and that also prevents me from really excelling at anything, i think.     


but it also feels like a depression thing.  it feels sorta cyclical; cant get immersed-->dont feel enjoyment-->cant get immersed.  which came first, idk, but the result is me being more or less numb.    and t his extends to so much beyond just liking things. its like part of who and how i am.   like afraid to be real.  so afraid that i forget how to stop being afraid, and when i start to mellow out, i get anxious becuse suddenly there's a weight to everything.  to social interactions. to the real world.  and then i go numb again, because its safer to have this hyper-aware, low level anxiety combined with a detachment from personal feelings, than to actually feel.   but feeling is what makes life worth living, obviously.   gotta take the good with the bad, or neither and end up with nothing.  but the bad psyches me out to the point of giving up on anything i started to be passionate about--thus cyclical.  its like my choices are: feel too much, or feel nothing.  yeah this is definitely beyond just imposter syndrome, but it also feels like it isnt. like its a part of imposter syndrome.

3343,"Ok, am I right or am I right that of the types of ""imposters"" there are, the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist"" types are absolutely the most screwed, pwahaha ([https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one))? Think about it. For the other imposter types listed, even if internally they feel like a mess, there are still some external benefits to their internal insecurity.

1. The perfectionist will still strive for that 100%. Even if they do miss that 1%, they are still going to probably be 99% better than most people.
2. The superwoman/man will work harder than anyone else. Even if they are insecure, their efforts show up in their work and gain them respect.
3. The expert gathers every piece of information and knowledge that they can. Even if their knowledge is incomplete, they still know more than probably the average person.

But the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist""? Lord help them. And by Lord help them, I mean Lord help me LMAO.

1. The soloist is fighting a losing battle. They are trying to go it alone WHILE also trying to be perfect. We all need mentors and teachers to help us to learn things! People will think that you are arrogant because you are trying to learn things on your own. And you most likely will also fail because who can succeed without the help of others?
2. And the ""natural genius""? Oh my goodness, this is even worse! Think about it: this person (me, lmao) delusionally thinks that they can excel WHILE on minimal effort AND on their first try. They give up easily at the sign of any challenge, because that's a sign that they aren't ""good"" or ""talented"" or ""smart"" enough. Therefore, they never actually excel at anything.

I feel like the first three (perfectionist, superwomen/man, expert) are almost like ""productive"" imposters. People that feel like imposters, but at least do something about it that can somewhat productively counteract those feelings.

But the bottom two, which I unfortunately am? It's like where you feel like you are an imposter, and instead of at the very least compensating for it, you just try to hide it... by trying to go it alone so that no one can see your imperfections at least for a short while (soloist) or by only ever sticking to things that are ""easy"" so that you can pretend like you are some sort of ""natural genius"" of some sort. 

Not to say that any of these are objectively supposed to be considered as ""good."" But I guess I'm just a little bit frustrated with myself...

3344,"I'm 20 years old now, grew up being told I was smart, have talents and even won an award in 7th grade called most likely to be a millionaire. My mom hangs it proudly in the house for show. She smiles when she looks at it.

Since then I went on to play chess at a national level, my first tournament I did poorly. The whole time, feeling like I was gonna be exposed, that my district wasn't good enough, that these smarter more intelligent kids would find me out. I capitulated. After that, my dad got drunk, told me I wasted his money and I never played it again. To this day.

And that's been a theme for me ever since. Since the age of 15. Had a bad bout of depression that seemed to come from nowhere, got into drugs and such, meth, codeine and self destruction. Got lucky, studied hard and went to college and now I'm 2 years clean.

But I'm still suffering the same thing. I no longer have the confidence to speak in a group of people, I always fear that they will remark something true about me. Figure me out before I finish.

Can't make many friends neither, they always seem to find out how weak I am and take advantage of me. Especially with women, I'm black so I date black girls. If you know black girls you know how mean they can be. Or maybe that's how I want to think of them.

They say I'm not bad looking, so girls sometimes get attracted to me. When they do I panic. Not because I'm scared of them, I've had girlfriends before but broke it off before they got too near. When girls want me I run away, I'm so afraid that they'll know what I'm all about. That I'm just a smoke screen for nothing that lies behind, hollow as can be.

Can't even walk in public in peace, always feel like somebody can see through me. I don't know how to explain it, sometimes people remark things that cut to the core.

Been called many things that were true. I can't even be around my step family, probably only 4 people in the world I can be myself around. Even then I think they're just entertaining me, laughing at me in secret. Criticising me. Maybe.

3345,"**EDIT:  I cross-posted this to** r/askpsychology **, and am much calmer than I was when I first posted.  I have settled into a tired, calm numbness, but I don't think that it is a bad thing, given the circumstances.** 

&#x200B;

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female.  I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work.  Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon.  My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack.  For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

&#x200B;

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud.  As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear.  I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome.  I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too.  Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it.  I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

&#x200B;

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten.  I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after.  I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter.  I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME.  I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me.  ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ <--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it.  I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

&#x200B;

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself.  But I am definitely in crisis.  The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline.  The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it.  I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me.  I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me.  That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

&#x200B;

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work.  I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth.  I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents).  I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is.  He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere.  I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me.  So I try to make him as happy as possible.  He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

&#x200B;

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life.  And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have.  In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can.  I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON.  Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine.  But I lie.  My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason.  I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day.  I ignore them.  One of these bills is for $8.  Eight fucking dollars.  I'm paralyzed about it.  I won't fix it.  These are only a few aspects of my life as examples.  I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships.  I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having.  I lie about having other plans.  I deserve to have my life fucked up.  I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway.  At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it...  It feels like my whole world is upside down.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, thank you.  I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this.  The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

&#x200B;

This is the first day of my life.  Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where.  I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing.  I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

&#x200B;

3346,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn‚Äôt put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn‚Äôt. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family‚Äôs and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if‚Äôs. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it‚Äôs why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I‚Äôve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what‚Äôs looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don‚Äôt look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it‚Äôs offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don‚Äôt have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We‚Äôll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don‚Äôt feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don‚Äôt treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven‚Äôt earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn‚Äôt earn it, that‚Äôs bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that‚Äôs where you go so ride it out. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don‚Äôt go down the dark hole there‚Äôs nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

Hi all,

I (27F) have always had ups and downs with anxiety, confidence and insecurity. I'm going through a rather difficult patch at the moment. I'm a journalist and I've just started a new job. I used to work on long form documentaries but making the switch back to daily news is really daunting.

I went through a very competitive interview process to get here, and I've always received very positive feedback on my work in every other job. So logically, I should feel like getting this job is really well-deserved.

However, the other members of the team are extremely good - intimidatingly so. There are many people here with a lot more experience than me (even the more junior members of the team) who seem to be far fuller of ideas than I am and much more vocal. They approach their work with a confidence and conviction that I can never see myself having.

I am much shyer than my coworkers and struggle to speak up in meetings. I have been trying to force myself to do this more, and even recently spoke at a public event to try and gain more confidence. It hasn't got any easier at all, and I still cringe when I hear myself speaking in front of a large group. I don't feel like my ideas are as original, creative, fully formed and well-thought out as the ones many others pitch. I spend hours researching topics I'm interested in, but I struggle to form proper stories out of my ideas and therefore don't pitch very often. I know I should arrange a meeting with my boss to talk about these issues, but I feel like they are always so busy and I don't want them to think they've made a mistake by hiring me if I highlight my insecurities.

Because I'm so intimidated by my coworkers, I feel reluctant to start conversations or even make small talk with them, even though I know I would benefit from doing this and learn a lot from them. I know it actually looks worse that I'm not taking the time to engage with them, but the thought of doing so makes me anxious.

I just feel like a great big fraud, really. I want to become a really good journalist, but I know this anxiety and lack of self-esteem is really holding me back.

Does anyone else here have similar experiences at work? Any tips that might help?

TL;DR: I'm struggling with imposter syndrome at work and it's affecting my ability to do my job and form relationships with my team. Any advice or details of similar experiences much appreciated!",originally posted rconfidencehttpswwwredditcomrconfidence rAnxiety obviously hugely relevant subreddit Hi 27F always ups down anxiety confidence insecurity Im going rather difficult patch moment Im journalist Ive started new job used work long form documentary making switch back daily news really daunting went competitive interview process get Ive always received positive feedback work every job logically feel like getting job really welldeserved However member team extremely good intimidatingly many people lot experience even junior member team seem far fuller idea much vocal approach work confidence conviction never see much shyer coworkers struggle speak meeting trying force even recently spoke public event try gain confidence hasnt got easier still cringe hear speaking front large group dont feel like idea original creative fully formed wellthought one many others pitch spend hour researching topic Im interested struggle form proper story idea therefore dont pitch often know arrange meeting bos talk issue feel like always busy dont want think theyve made mistake hiring highlight insecurity Im intimidated coworkers feel reluctant start conversation even make small talk even though know would benefit learn lot know actually look worse Im taking time engage thought make anxious feel like great big fraud really want become really good journalist know anxiety lack selfesteem really holding back anyone else similar experience work tip might help TLDR Im struggling imposter syndrome work affecting ability job form relationship team advice detail similar experience much appreciated,fear

Ever since I was little, I was taught that I was not as sick as I felt and just talking myself into it/faking it. The reasoning behind this was that I should learn to go to school no matter what because when you are a working adult you can't always be sick either. I also had a friend who was anxious about getting sick and dying because of every little discomfort (hypochondriac) and it made me scared that I could have the same disorder instead of being actually sick.

One moment I feel like this thinking has had a major impact on my physical health because I didnt take symptoms seriously, then I feel like an imposter who only feels sorry for themselves. Every time I have any symptoms I feel like a pussy and I had to learn the hard way that I have to take breaks for my immune system, I now have severe asthma with biweekly attacks. Btw even while having the attacks I feel like an imposter.

3354,"Hi everyone!

I've  been on a journey to improve my mental well-being and develop healthier thought patterns. Over the past year, I've faced challenges with  anxiety and found it difficult to break out of negative thought cycles. A. I  tried mindfulness exercises, but however hard I tried, I couldn't shut  off my thoughts. That's why I started looking for a different approach. That's when I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I started  challenging my unrealistic thoughts and learned how to react to them in a  more reasonable way.

However, doing this on your own, instead of with a therapist, is difficult. Even if you have a therapist, you only get help once a week instead of every time you are struggling with negative thoughts. So, I took matters  into my own hands and developed an app to make the process more  accessible and user-friendly. Here's how the app works:

1. Write a note whenever you find yourself overwhelmed by unhelpful thoughts.
2. The app analyzes your note, identifying common cognitive distortions.
3. Receive personalized suggestions to challenge and reframe your thoughts.

I've already got a couple hundred users and great feedback but I feel like imposter syndrome is basically the definition of distorted thinking, so I thought this might help a lot of you fighting imposter syndrome, and help me tailor the apps to your needs. The app is available as a beta on iOS and Android.

3355,"Maybe it‚Äôs just been a rough week but I just feel like I‚Äôm not cut out to be a tax accountant.

Long story short - I graduated college at the end of 2019 and started my first accounting job out of college at a really small firm, with no previous experience. I prepared mostly personal taxes, a few 1120s and 1065s, and was also involved in bookkeeping. There was minimal training and I really learned what I could from asking questions and just doing the work. I was with them for over 2 1/2 years but decided to leave due to off season stress of not having enough work (if I had no work they wouldn‚Äôt let me study for my CPA either) and the fact I didn‚Äôt see myself being promoted anytime soon (I was the only staff for a good 6 months towards the end).

I decided to go to a mid level firm and accepted a staff roll. I‚Äôve loved it so far and love all the opportunities I‚Äôm being given to work on bigger clients and focus on my weaker areas. However, I feel like coming in with 2 1/2 years I didn‚Äôt expect to have such a learning curve (I definitely knew I would come in with less experience in certain areas) Coming from a state with no income tax, working on mostly individuals, and having no actual formal training other than just on the job has put me at a disadvantage. I feel so dumb compared to other staff. I‚Äôve been put on large clients with multi-state returns, and many things I haven‚Äôt seen before (Which I‚Äôve disclosed). I‚Äôve tried my best to learn; but everything takes me longer, I‚Äôm still perfecting and trying to make my work papers clean, and I feel like I‚Äòm not doing good enough :( During engagement meetings I try and take very detailed notes - but I feel like I always miss something. Or my work papers aren‚Äôt done quite the right way for the reviewer - or I just misunderstand what should be done. I want to ask more questions, but I either feel too stupid or don‚Äôt know what to ask (Like I think I do understand something - when in reality I don‚Äôt) Most of the smaller returns I've worked  on I‚Äôve gotten good feedback on. I haven‚Äôt gotten any bad feedback so far - I can just know that it takes a lot more patience to work with me on bigger projects/ returns right now and certain reviewers probably get frustrated with me. I‚Äôve started to get anxiety while I‚Äôm working again and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm meeting expectations. I don‚Äôt feel like I can turn down work since I still am trying to prove myself and work with a variety of people - I‚Äôve taken maybe 2 actual days of PTO since busy season ended and I‚Äôm just feeling stressed. I‚Äôm just trying to keep pushing through knowing that maybe there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. It‚Äôs so frustrating after being in accounting as a staff for almost 3 1/2 years to feel this way, is accounting even what I want to pursue? Will I ever get better? I really want to be a CPA but I just feel like I‚Äôm too stupid. I feel like all my friends are getting promoted and doing amazing and their jobs just love them. I‚Äôm 25 and I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ever going to be successful :( 

It‚Äôs been a rough year for me with personal tragedy occurring in the middle of busy season as well. I‚Äôm in therapy to work on managing my busy schedule (both personally and at work) as well as work through some childhood trauma. I definitely feel like my personal issues during busy season did affect my work and motivation - but I‚Äôm trying to get back into it and I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing enough.",Maybe ‚Äô rough week feel like ‚Äô cut tax accountant Long story short graduated college end 2019 started first accounting job college really small firm previous experience prepared mostly personal tax 1120s 1065s also involved bookkeeping minimal training really learned could asking question work 2 12 year decided leave due season stress enough work work ‚Äô let study CPA either fact ‚Äô see promoted anytime soon staff good 6 month towards end decided go mid level firm accepted staff roll ‚Äô loved far love opportunity ‚Äô given work bigger client focus weaker area However feel like coming 2 12 year ‚Äô expect learning curve definitely knew would come le experience certain area Coming state income tax working mostly individual actual formal training job put disadvantage feel dumb compared staff ‚Äô put large client multistate return many thing ‚Äô seen ‚Äô disclosed ‚Äô tried best learn everything take longer ‚Äô still perfecting trying make work paper clean feel like ‚Äò good enough engagement meeting try take detailed note feel like always miss something work paper ‚Äô done quite right way reviewer misunderstand done want ask question either feel stupid ‚Äô know ask Like think understand something reality ‚Äô smaller return Ive worked ‚Äô gotten good feedback ‚Äô gotten bad feedback far know take lot patience work bigger project return right certain reviewer probably get frustrated ‚Äô started get anxiety ‚Äô working ‚Äô feel like ‚Äô meeting expectation ‚Äô feel like turn work since still trying prove work variety people ‚Äô taken maybe 2 actual day PTO since busy season ended ‚Äô feeling stressed ‚Äô trying keep pushing knowing maybe ‚Äô light end tunnel ‚Äô frustrating accounting staff almost 3 12 year feel way accounting even want pursue ever get better really want CPA feel like ‚Äô stupid feel like friend getting promoted amazing job love ‚Äô 25 ‚Äô feel like ‚Äô ever going successful ‚Äô rough year personal tragedy occurring middle busy season well ‚Äô therapy work managing busy schedule personally work well work childhood trauma definitely feel like personal issue busy season affect work motivation ‚Äô trying get back ‚Äô feel like ‚Äô enough,trust
3356,"I‚Äôm so beyond grateful for the support of my family, friends, and boyfriend and their words of congratulations to me. A small part of me thinks ‚Äúyeah I did that, I accomplished it,‚Äù but the bigger part of me doesn‚Äôt know why I feel nothing.

My time as a piano major was extremely stressful, not in the academic way but in a personal way that was tied to my professors. After graduating from my two year college, my private instructor there cut me off completely. It was confusing because we were so close, she was someone I told everything to. My last conversation with her, I revealed to her that my sister was taken by CPS and I was diagnosed with RA. I tried to follow up with her but she never responded. I don‚Äôt resent her for it, I‚Äôm still very confused and hurt that after 2-3 years of talking to her almost everyday, she refused to say hello or even ask how I was doing after transferring to university.

Almost immediately after moving away from family to continue my studies, I learned about my sister and CPS and it impacted my ability to focus or perform, which is huge since I was literally a performance major and I was performing every week. I thought I had gained trust with one of my piano professors, so I told him what was going on. He was so supportive until my last day of class when he told me how disappointed he was in my final class performance but that he would still give me an A out of pity for me. That should‚Äôve made me feel grateful but I felt so humiliated. In my last year at university, my new private lesson instructor made me feel like I had learned nothing while at school, saying I wouldn‚Äôt pass my recital hearing (basically a test to see if I‚Äôm ready to perform my senior recital) and even threatening my graduation date. He would also say things like ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt made any progress‚Äù but in the same breath tell me I‚Äôve come a long way, which confused me. Small things like that added up to an entire list, most of which is made up of negative commentary.

Now I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I deserve only praise. I‚Äôm well aware that I‚Äôm not a prodigy and that I‚Äôm not going to make a career out of performing because it‚Äôs not something I feel I have the constitution for. Sure, I enjoy the occasional performance especially in front of audiences that are supportive and want to hear what I have to share. I actually just had my debut in Colombia in April where I got to teach a masterclass and then perform in the concert hall in front of 500 people. They were so incredibly kind and they are still reaching out to me to tell me how much they loved hearing me play.

So why, after seeing my own progress and being happy with how I progressed, especially as someone in a field where there are so many incredible and inspiring musicians, do I feel like I didn‚Äôt do what I was supposed to? I used to be so proud of the music I shared because I genuinely felt like I was meant to do this, but then hearing these professors who used to attend Juilliard and Curtis and had well-established careers that I‚Äôm a disappointment made me feel like no matter how hard I try, I‚Äôll never be worthy of praise. And now that I have my degree, all I can think about is the pain associated with my years at college. That I may have improved slightly but in the long run, it doesn‚Äôt matter.",‚Äô beyond grateful support family friend boyfriend word congratulation small part think ‚Äú yeah accomplished ‚Äù bigger part ‚Äô know feel nothing time piano major extremely stressful academic way personal way tied professor graduating two year college private instructor cut completely confusing close someone told everything last conversation revealed sister taken CPS diagnosed RA tried follow never responded ‚Äô resent ‚Äô still confused hurt 23 year talking almost everyday refused say hello even ask transferring university Almost immediately moving away family continue study learned sister CPS impacted ability focus perform huge since literally performance major performing every week thought gained trust one piano professor told going supportive last day class told disappointed final class performance would still give pity ‚Äô made feel grateful felt humiliated last year university new private lesson instructor made feel like learned nothing school saying ‚Äô pas recital hearing basically test see ‚Äô ready perform senior recital even threatening graduation date would also say thing like ‚Äú ‚Äô made progress ‚Äù breath tell ‚Äô come long way confused Small thing like added entire list made negative commentary ‚Äô going pretend like deserve praise ‚Äô well aware ‚Äô prodigy ‚Äô going make career performing ‚Äô something feel constitution Sure enjoy occasional performance especially front audience supportive want hear share actually debut Colombia April got teach masterclass perform concert hall front 500 people incredibly kind still reaching tell much loved hearing play seeing progress happy progressed especially someone field many incredible inspiring musician feel like ‚Äô supposed used proud music shared genuinely felt like meant hearing professor used attend Juilliard Curtis wellestablished career ‚Äô disappointment made feel like matter hard try ‚Äô never worthy praise degree think pain associated year college may improved slightly long run ‚Äô matter,trust

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

It's like I think I'm supposed to know everything about something if I'm interested in it. Otherwise I'm just posing.

It is an awesome song, but at that very moment I started feeling like a poser, because if I don't know that song then I don't really know anything about the band and I don't really enjoy them, I'm just faking.

When I was in the thick of my graduate curriculum I always received good grades and got things done on time, but I think I just learned how to do homework really well. For example, I was taking my degree at an accelerated rate in order to graduate sooner, so I was completing more classes than was recommended or than what my peers were. Because of this, a lot of the assigned reading/work for each class was doubled so I physically wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete all of it exactly as I should‚Äôve, in a timely manner, while also trying to live a life and working full time. My work around was that I would skim a lot of it, and never do any of the optional or supplemental work. I would give the bare minimum of effort on assignments, in order to get an A or high B. And it worked, like I said I completed my curriculum with a high 3.8 GPA. But now‚Ä¶ I think I really regret not reading everything word for word. I feel like I can‚Äôt even tell you what I learned.

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

¬∑ Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô.

3389,"Hi everyone,

I (fairly) recently got promoted at work, and I‚Äôve been really struggling with what I‚Äôm assuming is imposter‚Äôs syndrome ever since. :( I‚Äôm finding it really really hard. 

My job is research based, originally I was doing more admin tasks and I was quite happy and confident in what I was doing. After my promotion I became more directly involved with conducting the research itself. It‚Äôs a big change in my role and the day-to-day activities in my job.

When I went for the promotion, I kind of worried this would happen. I‚Äôm a people pleaser, I suffer with social anxiety and OCD, so I did think that this might be too much for me, but there was pressure to go for it from colleagues, friends, family etc. I thought getting promoted would look good to others and therefore make me feel better about myself :( 

However now I‚Äôm stuck in the job and I‚Äôm just really struggling. We have deadlines, so I feel like I‚Äôm constantly rushing to finish things. When I rush, I get stressed because the quality of my work isn‚Äôt as good as I feel it should be. I worry there are mistakes that I don‚Äôt have time to rectify, then I worry that the mistakes mean I‚Äôm not good enough to be in this role. I‚Äôm also slower because I meticulously check everything for errors, which I worry doesn‚Äôt look good for my performance, further proving to myself that I don‚Äôt deserve this job. Generally I‚Äôm worried my lack of knowledge is going to be revealed somehow, that there will be some huge problem with my work that I won‚Äôt spot because I‚Äôm not intelligent enough etc. I then worry I‚Äôll get fired from my job. 

I think this is all kind of linked to the OCD. The perfectionism, the meticulous checking like I just can‚Äôt let go. I‚Äôve always struggled with these things, but the imposter‚Äôs syndrome has never been as bad as this. I dread getting up and going to work now, whereas I never used to mind it. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my boss about the struggles a little, but I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself and don‚Äôt want to admit how hard I‚Äôm finding it. 

Does anyone relate to this? Any tips on making it more bearable? I‚Äôm feeling really useless at the moment :(

3399,"This is my first time posting here.
I, 34M, am highly doubting my work competences.
I‚Äôve been reading about imposter and think this is what I have.

Let me give background. I come from a family of High intellectual potentials. Although never tested, both my sisters are diagnosed.
I am very sensitive to the opinion of others.

In school, I always succeeded with little effort. I never hid that I did not work and got many jealousy as a result. So I hid my grades.
In university, I got great grades while my gf, now wife, had a harder time, although we studied the same. (She made the schedule).

I‚Äôm quite sure I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten my degree without her planning.

After my master, I did a PhD, got praise from the jury. But if you ask me, I‚Äôll tell you my research wasn‚Äôt worth it, it contributed 0 to science and only got published because my supervisor was good at writing.

I did a Postdoc but then completely changed field.
I felt inadequate in that job, that I wasn‚Äôt properly qualified for it.
During my postdoc, I passed a teacher certification, which was easy. 
I couldn‚Äôt continue the classes, so I ended up going straight for the jury and received the certification, thanks to my good memories from the previous year lesson.

I did not start working as a teacher, I did something completely different still.
I‚Äôve been doing that job for 3 years. I started mid 2019 and we soon had Covid. I have been unable to resume ‚Äúas before‚Äù. I feel like nothing I do makes a difference so I avoid doing. I‚Äôm failing this job and my boss will soon figure it out. Although so far no one said I was doing an inappropriate job.

I then requested to change position in August. And am transitioning positions currently.

Todays, had a progress meeting and was only told I need to make sure I plan and prioritize better. I know this is a weakness I have. I‚Äôm too ¬´¬†hot¬†¬ª, in the moment.

I procrastinate until last minute and then rush to finish. Mostly because tasks seem impossible. And am not happy because the result is not exactly as I imagined it.

Now I‚Äôm lost.
Is it imposter, am I just incompetent, am I really not organized enough, am I just too perfectionist?
I feel like I‚Äôm exaggerating thinking it‚Äôs imposter.

I‚Äôm thinking of seeking help, but first, how do you tell your wife you feel like a failure undeserving of your position?

Naturally, during PhD impostor syndrome was there at all times. Main ""reasoning"" why I'm going to be fired were common ADHD symptoms: forgetting, chaos, lack of planning skills etc. I covered it all by working much more than my peers, hence I felt I don't belong since others didn't have to work that hard to be there. 

Edit: As for my partner, I couldn't take that she offers me a significant help to tackle the issue with the job, so I moved out from her.

3405,"TL;DR: I landed an internship at the highest ranked law firm in my country bc I‚Äôm skilled at taking exams, not because I‚Äôm super smart. Also, my writing skills aren‚Äôt great. I feel like such an impostor and like I‚Äôm going to fail before everyone‚Äôs eyes/get a bad internship-report/grade after my internship ends. Any advice? - Not necessarily looking for life changing solutions (although welcome!), but any advice/tips/words of encouragement or other opinions are appreciated :) 

*edit: the ‚Äòhighest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it‚Äôs one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt belong there

‚Äî-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I‚Äôve been more insecure than ever lately & I‚Äôm having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‚Äòranked‚Äô #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don‚Äôt always say everything - but let‚Äôs just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it‚Äôs because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‚Äòhonors/cum laude‚Äô grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I‚Äôm not trying to say I‚Äôm absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I‚Äôm not actually super talented, I‚Äôm just good at ‚Äòtaking exams‚Äô + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I‚Äôm neurodivergent and am quite ‚Äòslow‚Äô in understanding things (even if it‚Äôs something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful.

But.........I feel like a rookie. There are some many new processes and systems to understand and these things take time which isn't always easy to find when you are doing daily fire fighting dealing with sickness, safeguardings, shift cover, being a smiling friendly face of the home with a need to promote it as a business etc etc. Yesterday I was filled with anxiety, today has been better but the lurking fear is there that I will be found out as not able to do the job

I also need to watch what I'm saying to people as my usual line at the minute is, well I'm new and still learning so I don't know all the answers etc etc but I'll try my best

There's so much to learn and I'm committed to that and determined, I can usually harness the anxiety as that's just normal part of growth and new situations but I'm off the back of a bad work experience about a year ago when I got bullied out of somewhere when people played on weaknesses and I didn't think I was supported well or had a good induction

3419,"The title summarises most of this but basically, I get a lot of compliments from people. Like a lot a lot. I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre. Not to say there's anything wrong with being average, I don't mind it,  but,  well,  yeah, I'm average. Yet everyone insists I'm not. It's gotten to the point where I assume that it's because of my disability.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends. I just feel ashamed when people with so many accolades Call ME smart or talented.

3425,"I'm a wedding photographer in the UK and have done it since around 2014. I started by doing a few friends weddings and it grew from there to where I now have almost 50 weddings a year.  

I used to really enjoy the job and my work but the more I do it, the faker I feel and the more I worry. I feel that I've marketed myself really well rather than people booking me for my work itself. I feel that I have a fairly realistic idea of how good I am at wedding photography and while I wouldn't put myself at the very bottom, I know I have a long way to go before I would ever like my own work.   

A couple who live in Canada found my Instagram and have booked me for their wedding in France which is happening in a weeks time. I have never felt more like a fraud in my entire life. The pressure is huge. They are paying me to go to France to take their wedding photos. This is now no longer that I just happen to be a local wedding photographer who knows a local venue well.... this is now a case where someone has found me and could have picked anyone in the entire UK or most of Europe! Why me? My work really isn't that good! It's average at best. I rarely even post on Instagram so I don't even know how they came across my page.   

The pressure of photographing their wedding and delivering their images is now weighing so heavy on my shoulders. I'm already going through a mental battle right now with medical testing for what could be a serious life-threatening disease. The added pressure of now having to go to France next week to photograph a wedding is huge.    

I don't even get much feedback from couples anymore either. I used to send off the photos and they would email me back telling me how much they love their photos and then would write a review. I've not had that much recently. I send the photos off and hear absolutely nothing from them ever again. So naturally I ruminate and think that they dislike their images. I keep wondering if I'm doing something different than I used to or if I've become complacent but I'm not so sure. I put in so much effort on my wedding days.

3432,"I battled a brain tumor called a vestibular schwannoma all of last year. It hurt. I was in so much pain, feeling so dizzy like a mix of a bad hangover and the stomach virus. I'd feel intensely weak, confused, and haunted by a vicious ringing in my ear. It was like hearing a bagpipe or teakettle going off in my ears 24/7, while the other symptoms happened EVERYDAY for hours on end, to barying degrees. The vertigo was also terrible. Sometimes I'd fall over. Sometimes I'd have a panic attack while going through it. Sometimes it'd last for hours. It would even keep me from sleeping. Then there are the dangerous situations I was put in because of the loss of balance and loss of hearing 

Due to the COVID pandemic, it was t easy to seek professional medical care. Doctors would make me wait months or even into the next year which I outright refused. I took my own data on my symptoms, my medication, my food, ans the time of day these symptoms happened, all to give insight and remove any extraneous variables as to what was happening. The ER doctors couldnt help me as they didn't find a brain tumor on the CT scan. It wasn't until I got an MRI two months later while going through all of this, that the WNT diagnosed the brain tumor. Not to mention the severe hearing loss in both ears, especially the left.

I saw the best in others and I saw the worst. My mental health suffered while waiting for care. And worst of all the doctors were somewhat dismissive of my needs. It wasn't until I saw a doctor at Duke University Medical Center, one of the most advanced medical centers in the world for skull base tumors, even able to perform operations no other medical center can, that I got real help.

A Vestibular Achwannoma has a high survival rate. Mine wasn't that big at 7mm ans some survive even larger. 

I talk a lot about it on my GoFundMe my friends made, where I post updates and on social media as well.

And yet, a part of me feels like maybe it wasn't that bad. I didn't die. I didn't end up like the others who are worse off than I am today. I felt I was dying and was even suicidal, thinking and plotting ways to off myself that would be considered an accident. I didn't want to live life with the amount of hearing loss I had, the potential for permanent dizziness, ans these tormenting symptoms to continue even after surgery (which the symptoms have since resolved sans the hearing loss).

Maybe I'm a whiner. Maybe I'm not simply updating friends and gsmiyl, but looking for attention. Maybe I shouldn't have spent my GoFundMe donations on more than just medical bills - like a dietician, additional physical therapy, and yoga lessons. All were to help me adjust to life after a brain tumor and improve my almost non-existent balance. But it wasn't specifically necessary, even if it worked.

I know what I went through was real, and nobody else's opinion on the matter has any meaning but mine. Even now, I still talk to a therapist who I've seem throughout this process. She says this is normal for many, these feelings. What I went through was real. Did someone doubt me? Yep, but nobody else sided with those people.

And yet, I sometimes wonder of the worst days of my life were really pain, agony, and loss, or simply exaggerating for help.",battled brain tumor called vestibular schwannoma last year hurt much pain feeling dizzy like mix bad hangover stomach virus Id feel intensely weak confused haunted vicious ringing ear like hearing bagpipe teakettle going ear 247 symptom happened EVERYDAY hour end barying degree vertigo also terrible Sometimes Id fall Sometimes Id panic attack going Sometimes itd last hour would even keep sleeping dangerous situation put loss balance loss hearing Due COVID pandemic easy seek professional medical care Doctors would make wait month even next year outright refused took data symptom medication food an time day symptom happened give insight remove extraneous variable happening ER doctor couldnt help didnt find brain tumor CT scan wasnt got MRI two month later going WNT diagnosed brain tumor mention severe hearing loss ear especially left saw best others saw worst mental health suffered waiting care worst doctor somewhat dismissive need wasnt saw doctor Duke University Medical Center one advanced medical center world skull base tumor even able perform operation medical center got real help Vestibular Achwannoma high survival rate Mine wasnt big 7mm an survive even larger talk lot GoFundMe friend made post update social medium well yet part feel like maybe wasnt bad didnt die didnt end like others worse today felt dying even suicidal thinking plotting way would considered accident didnt want live life amount hearing loss potential permanent dizziness an tormenting symptom continue even surgery symptom since resolved sans hearing loss Maybe Im whiner Maybe Im simply updating friend gsmiyl looking attention Maybe shouldnt spent GoFundMe donation medical bill like dietician additional physical therapy yoga lesson help adjust life brain tumor improve almost nonexistent balance wasnt specifically necessary even worked know went real nobody el opinion matter meaning mine Even still talk therapist Ive seem throughout process say normal many feeling went real someone doubt Yep nobody else sided people yet sometimes wonder worst day life really pain agony loss simply exaggerating help,fear

So I'm like, 'look how much of a fuckup I am, that I can't even entice vendors', I was convinced that I'd sounded like an asshat, not knowing what I was talking about.  At the same time, I got pissy with a customer because they were asking about a bunch of asinine stuff, so then I spent two days convinced I was going to get fired for pissing off a customer.  And add to it, my mentor asked how I was doing, and I wrote back this 'fear of failure' thing, and then didn't hear back from him...

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.  And my mentor made this long apology about how he should be doing better by me if I feel like a failure, that he loves working with me, etc.

It's all just so tough to believe sometimes...  I'm totally convinced I should be a janitor, that I'm not worth a damn to this company I've been a manager at for nearly twenty years.  And I'll go through periods when I feel good about myself, but mostly I'm convinced others are being overly nice to me and/or they just haven't figured that I'm a fraud yet...",last week losing mind Ive negotiating potential vendor meeting afterward didnt hear day Im like look much fuckup cant even entice vendor convinced Id sounded like asshat knowing talking time got pissy customer asking bunch asinine stuff spent two day convinced going get fired pissing customer add mentor asked wrote back fear failure thing didnt hear back spent last week thinking resigning one employee Ill go back working janitor etc vendor got back dealing Covid crisis still absolutely want work bos told customer bunch jerk right putting crap back mentor made long apology better feel like failure love working etc tough believe sometimes Im totally convinced janitor Im worth damn company Ive manager nearly twenty year Ill go period feel good mostly Im convinced others overly nice andor havent figured Im fraud yet,trust

I was in a really competitive high school a few years back, and actually managed to get great grades but was seen as the ‚Äúsmart kid‚Äù and my friends and teachers judged me a lot if I wasn‚Äôt getting into a prestigious program or school or if I did less well on tests which we had every week, and my mental health was really bad as a result. A lot of my friends had really toxic or abusive relationships (platonic romantic familial) and always leveraged off success as their defining ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing better‚Äù kind of moment, and it compelled me to do the same even though it was destroying me. Fast forward and I‚Äôve graduated a long time ago and no longer talk to anyone there. 

I‚Äôve noticed that my imposter syndrome has gotten so bad and ironically manifests in little white lies. For example, I‚Äôve been telling people that I got into X university when they ask but decided not to go; but the truth is I didn‚Äôt even apply there. I hate how easily little lies like this slip out of my mouth even when meeting new people when they ask, and I really want to stop even though these lies have no effect on serious aspects of my life :( yesterday I met someone new and this slipped out yet again, and it just bothers me so much. 

I go to a great college now that I worked my ass off to get into, but I feel like a Personality Imposter if that makes sense, and I‚Äôm surrounded by all these super talented people who are really passionate and collaborative and the brightest people in their countries etc. it really sucks that I simultaneously want to celebrate my successes which I know are valid but it feels like my whole life they were nothing compared to others.

3443,"Hi community. My first post in this community and I am curious about how Imposter Syndrome shows not only in your life but also specifically in relationships. 

About me: I am 37, almost 38, first and foremost a musician who has struggled with performance anxiety and always trying to give my best but then always end up thinking it wasn‚Äôt good enough, or that there‚Äôs someone better than me. Add in having parents who constantly asked why I wasn‚Äôt doing well in college and subsequently thinking they are always judging my every move in life. 

But I think most notably I struggle with my Imposter Syndrome surfacing in my relationships. I am gay and have had a couple significant relationships in my life, my last one being 7 years with someone who I viewed as more successful than me, smarter, etc. I am now entering a new relationship with a very creative person (who has admitted his own struggles with Imposter) but who has that ability to be confident, and show his self so strongly. As this relationship is going I find myself thinking thoughts that tear down every facet of hope in this relationship. And I am madly and deeply in love more and more every day.  Like, ‚Äúwhat does this guy want with you, you don‚Äôt talk strong like he does, you don‚Äôt have strong opinions, you‚Äôre not good enough for him, if he really gets to know you he won‚Äôt like you, one day he will meet someone else that is better than you‚Äù

3447,"This is my first post here. I'm sorry if I break any rules.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone. Even though I know that I suffer from imposter syndrome, (I'm in therapy for this and other reasons), I TRUELY believe that what I'm doing is bad and that I am stupid. People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

Update: I handed it in last week!! The only thought that kept me going was ""It doesn't matter if it's bad. Just finish it somehow."" I couldn't convince myself that what I doing was good.

3452,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I‚Äôm in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

‚ÄúYou went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won‚Äôt make enough because of it to make that ok‚Äù

‚ÄúYour almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??‚Äù

It‚Äôs the answer to the last one that makes me realize I‚Äôve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I‚Äôve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I‚Äôm a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn‚Äôt know I just couldn‚Äôt hack it academically, even though I‚Äôve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn‚Äôt worked, it‚Äôs because those around me wouldn‚Äôt let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fianc√© before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù and snap everyone around me out of it.

Because I'm good at what I do.

I didn't ""fumble"" because ""I'm an inherent failure."" I experienced a very normal situation and nobody batted an eye.

3463,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.

I failed a class last semester and for some reason it hasn't hit me. I know I'm supposed to feel bad about it but when I see the failing number, I don't know what I feel. I hate talking about grades, some days they matter and other days they don't.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university. The stuff with new guidelines but no updates and whenever I get an update email I tell myself I'll read it later but never do it. Even though it's easier than ever to get in touch in a person with just a click of a button it feels even harder because I don't know who I'm getting in touch with.

I know that I've got bad study habits but breaking them feels impossible. I have good intentions of bettering myself but the rest of my body doesn't listen to my mind. When I tell myself I'll set a routine, I set it, then I don't follow it. I'm just really lost right now.

3470,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm so glad to find this sub. I‚Äôm a new graduate, I just graduated in October. My last semester was extremely light only 2 courses so I began looking and applying for full time jobs in the summer itself. I found a remote part time job on contract that I have until this april and took it so I‚Äôd have something to do while I look for full time. My father passed away in September and I didn‚Äôt actively look for a while before or after.

Now, after a couple months of very consistent applying for probably hundreds of jobs and 3 interviews- I got a full time permanent job offer at a GREAT company, in my field too. Excellent entry level opportunity. My mom is over the moon and so are family and friends BUT.. 

The position is set to start in July and every single day I feel like I will lose it before even starting it. That I will receive an email one random day and they just take it back for no reason. My mom wanted to celebrate with friends and I refuse to. I feel like I would just have to inform everyone that I lost it. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I could possibly get an opportunity this good. Why would they pick me? Undoubtedly I have peers that are just as smart if not smarter. They obviously will realise that before July or something totally improbable like the position just being eliminated from the organisation. 

Irrationally I feel like I only got it as a small good happening to us after something so horribly painful. Like there‚Äôs a scale to balance my pain and happiness and it‚Äôs being tipped slightly.

3480,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you‚Äôre succeeding, even if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the skills,‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You‚Äôre succeeding. It‚Äôs the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that‚Äôs who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It‚Äôs hard to tell internally whether you‚Äôre funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You‚Äôre not a good judge of that. You‚Äôre on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people‚Äôs actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it‚Äôs so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn‚Äôt be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There‚Äôs no downside. Even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it or supposedly don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you‚Äôll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don‚Äôt know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I‚Äôll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I‚Äôve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I‚Äôve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there‚Äôs a more tangible motivator- ‚ÄòI really want to have a good day, and it‚Äôs statistically much more likely if I‚Äôm productive.‚Äô Try it if you‚Äôd like. Idk. I didn‚Äôt keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain‚Äôt real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it‚Äôs happening, that‚Äôs a fantastic help. It‚Äôs even better when/if you‚Äôre able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I‚Äôm rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you‚Äôll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful.  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others. I have hesitated to share my thoughts here for fear of being insensitive to others that need more assistance. I appologize in advance if I offend anyone, know that I didnt have malicious intentions. A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

I would appreciate any perspectives. Even critical negitive ones will help me see if my problem is important or not, even though I understand it is something many go through.

Once again, I hope I haven't offended anyone, I promise I had no ill intentions.",Hello would like thank anyone reading taking time life read stranger thought starting high school soon understand age problem like common trying find outward perspective others hesitated share thought fear insensitive others need assistance appologize advance offend anyone know didnt malicious intention disclaimer first paragraph may sound little arrogant said feel dont deserve life grown fortunate area many student highly academic Personally others see pretty good light someone model student good aconplishments However year go feel like dont deserve life didnt work hard ebough thing done see others working hard feel level Yet part preventing motivated work would appreciate perspective Even critical negitive one help see problem important even though understand something many go hope havent offended anyone promise ill intention,trust
3483,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me.

3485,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them. Sorry this is so long, most of you probably won't even get to the end but my point is: is the way I felt about being called a hero imposter syndrome?",context used house directly across street workplace work gas station old man lived sister would regularly come store help couple minor chore like taking trash really enjoyed helping think needed thing occupy time gave much free food drink wanted basically sweet old man store street corner house street corner right across u really shitty intersection people often run red light cut parking lot going way fast old man fruit stand front portion house porch would hit car time year one night month ago dude crashed directly house old man bedroom thankfully wasnt part way living room shattered main support beam house inside time coworker heard loud crash went outside see happened saw truck started freaking rushed see old man ok dug rubble trying get old man passed truck ended unburying driver door couldnt get farther checked dude hurt said shoulder hurt lot bleeding conscious seemed pain mostly ok left paramedic look arrived went around side truck find way heard old man calling broke door probably shouldnt house wasnt exactly stable started calling name could find wasnt buried whole lot debris couple wall worth stuff completely hidden view use voice find exactly uncover pull Later night coworker called hero next day another coworker thing next day also reporter going interviewing old man wanted know got assume interview well tried point shook head said wasnt turned walked away made extremely uncomfortable especially people calling hero face wasnt feeling modesty like oh anyone would would call positive emotion Like thank nice Im hero like aversion called negative emotion like absolutely dont call dont deserve called havent told anyone wife people store coworkers regular customer know people talk rural community didnt tell Sorry long probably wont even get end point way felt called hero imposter syndrome,anticipation

When I buy/have something whether a piece of electronics or something cheaper like lotion or anything, I feel like I need to ration it or use it lightly.

What made me realize it is my laptop, the surface pro 3 I got 5 years ago I've always felt weird using it, but now that I was just given the pro 7 for Christmas I feel way more comfortable using the old one because I know if it breaks I'll have another chance. (poverty/scarcity mindset, perfectionism, deficit thinking, low self esteem/worth and imposter syndrome. I also have trauma, codependency and anxious attachment)  To heal this I'm trying to tell myself things like ""take up space"" and ""it's okay to touch things"" ""it's okay to make mistakes"".

I was pretty indifferent towards them. But after a conversation that I had with Dylan about them, I love them. Feel almost that I have no right liking them.

* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment.

I have imposter syndrome and also very low self esteem, which is a fun combination. Or maybe that is common?

It seems I am always just waiting for someone to call me out on being a total fake. Just waiting on a phone call, an email, a knock at the door to say ""ok, you've been discovered, we know you arent really what you say you are, and are just faking this life""

I know that sounds completely crazy! I dont even know who would do that, or how or why!

And with the low self esteem, I would believe anything negative said about me long before believing anything positive.

I sit down to start designing my portfolio and then good ole Mr.IS creeps in the back of my mind telling me ""no business would want my coding skills, psshhh skills you can't even code"" there have been moments I've just sat at my keyboard and cried because it's such a hard thing to wrestle with. 

Recently I've been fighting a wrongful termination with FedEx Ground. During my paid suspension I really hit that course hard working everyday on it. I was so excited when I made a very rudimentary To-Do list out of Html, CSS and JavaScript considering it was really my first time using JavaScript to create something.

My wife u/mrsjamiel has been nothing but supportive and wanting me to finish this course but I'm just having a hard time of grappling with the imposter syndrome. 


The other thing that's causing this is, I finished the Frontend Web Developer section of the course. So now I'm doing backend. It's just alot because now it's more routing pages, server side code with Node.js GET PULL PUSH REQUEST REQUIRE RESPOND etc and it's like am I in way over my head?

3527,"This post is a bit long, my apologies in advance. 


I‚Äôve been a professional musician for 5 years now. In terms of performing, I have worked past my feelings of feeling inadequate. At this point it‚Äôs audio engineering and teaching that are a struggle for me.

As a teacher I‚Äôve been teaching online since 2018. I have nothing but 5 star reviews, but I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough for my students. I went to school for music and think I‚Äôm reasonably well trained, but I have this anxiety that with each student at some point I‚Äôm going to run out of helpful things to tell them and I‚Äôll just be getting paid to sit with them while they practice. I often get nervous during my lessons that students feel I‚Äôm wasting their time, but they come back from week to week. 

As an audio engineer I also started in 2018. I did not have a ton of experience, so I charged a small fee and did the best I could. I did NOT go to school to become an audio engineer, but decided to do it after college. I‚Äôve took an intensive course helping me to feel more confident in my tracking, editing, and mixing abilities, as well as joining an online cohort for 6 months to get feedback on my work. I‚Äôve put in time and I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with some great clients... but I am going to be working with a group signed to Warner Bros. and I just feel like I‚Äôm not worthy. I forced myself to take the opportunity, but I am really nervous about it. I am also working on an album for a vocal band right now and feel like I‚Äôm not doing them justice, despite saying they‚Äôre loving the product thus far. 

I try not to let my feelings of being a fraud interfere with my life and the business I‚Äôve built for myself... and I try to push myself to take opportunities even if I‚Äôm not comfortable with it...  but I know in my heart of hearts that my feelings are affecting my ability to do my best work and have periodically paralyzed me with fear.

3532,"My tutoring company has been doing remote work due to COVID, and they are starting to look into some in-person tutoring, given that both the client and tutor are comfortable. I have the option of being an in-person tutor again, in which I get paid a little more. I'm not personally scared of COVID from tutoring, so I am considering it. I worry though about being a good enough tutor. And so far the two students I've had who switched tutors‚ÄîI'm assuming because they didn't like me‚Äîwere ones I went to see in person, as opposed to in the office or remote. 

If I may vent, I was academically successful until college, at which point, I got by. I mean, I went to a prestigious STEM school and graduated in good standing with a BS in CS-Math. I think I got honors in CS. And I love helping people, tutored on-campus, and even tutored young kids over the phone. So I'm capable.

However, I'm not confident. And I don't do well under pressure. Like once I was doing an interview, I was asked to calculate the value of 5/8 without a calculator. I said 1.6 or something. At which point, the interviewer guided me to the realization that 5/8 is less than 1, so how is 1.6 reasonable?

I've had my tutoring job for less than a year. But I have been in it for over half a year, so I think I'm past the ""oh, you're new, mistakes happen"" phase. I believe I have the foundational knowledge I need, but I don't think I have the... sufficient knowledge that other tutors seem to have to confidently answer any kid's question. I find myself often saying that I need to get back to a kid on that. I don't know all the answers, despite having resources, answer keys, and time to plan. Nor am I motivated to give even more time to learning as I have already. 

So I feel like an imposter. Either because I am less competent than my fellow tutors or because I don't want to put in the effort I'd need to be as competent as them. 

Yesterday, I had one remote lesson to teach in the evening. All day I'd been anxious about it. It wasn't horrible anxiety, but it was present. And the lesson was fine. I expected it to be fine. But I still felt scared. 

I feel like an imposter. And I don't like it. But this tutoring job is so flexible and has such a respectful community, that I don't think I should give it up. If something feels wrong, I figure I must be at fault.

3540,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

I ended this year with 3.9 gpa and try to tell myself that this is proof that i belong at this uni, but immediately after i say that, i think that i only got this gpa on luck. i only got this gpa because im not a stem major and i spend most of my time on getting good grades so its not an accomplishment

a few days ago, i got accepted for a research assistant position with one of my professors. i havent been able to have a stable emotion for 5 minutes straight and feel that at any moment the prof will tell me that the email was a mistake or that she wants to fire me. im so scared to start research because im terrified that she will realize i am not as smart as my gpa shows and will despise me. i know people much smarter and accomplished than me who applied for this position and didnt get it. i dont know why i got it, it feels like some kind of sick joke- it feels like a dream or a nightmare. ive never had any research experience before this, ive literally worked only part time jobs rolling burritos or lifeguarding in order to help my family.

3543,"I am new to this sub but I wanted to throw a suggestion out. One of the pieces of advice I received about managing imposter syndrome was to keep a running list of positive feedback, accomplishments (big or small), successes, and compliments to reflect on and help to combat feelings of incompetence and not belonging.  

I wonder if folks on here would find any value in having a weekly thread where everyone could just comment with their weekly successes, accomplishments, or positive feedback received. I was thinking there would be no expectation about what success (etc.) means. Someone could write that they remembered to water the plants this week or they got a B on a paper or someone complimented the way they drafted that email or they felt like they might look dumb but they mustered the courage to ask that question in class anyway. The central idea being that it might help us remind ourselves that we do have skill, we are competent, we do belong. It could be a way for us to support one another as well. 

One potential downside I could see is that if folks are listing their successes it might make someone feel more like an imposter if they don't feel like they have something to contribute. Or with the process of upvoting someone might feel bad because they only got 2 but someone else got 10. But my hope would be that we could all support each other in whatever successes people post whether it seem small or large. If folks are interested we could assess how it's going after a few weeks or so and make sure it's helpful, not harmful.

3545,"Hi all,

I'm here to share my story and wondering if anyone has any advice... a long post ahead (apologies).

I moved to a new country in mid 2018 with a job in a field I wanted to be in.

Prior to my move overseas, I was doing pretty ok at my job and enjoyed it well enough to keep going everyday.  I entered into the field as a graduate and did pretty well there. My job involves analytical thinking and using numbers on a daily basis. At school, math has never been my forte and I've always felt a sense of anxiety towards it for a number of reasons (e.g shamed in front of peers, parental pressure etc.). However, when I moved overseas and got a job in the same field, things started to go downhill.

The overseas job was fundamentally similar to what I was previously doing, but much more complex and customised work. I was making errors and mistakes on basic stuff. My anxiety increased exponentially and everyday I felt like I was going to be revealed as someone who is incompetent. I did my very best and worked really hard to double, triple check my work but it was a cycle of stress and anxiety as I felt less confident and would catastrophize every situation in my head (e.g. I'm going to get fired then get deported...) Coupled with the fact that my boss was a grammar nazi and had really strong eye for detail... I lasted a year and a half before I was let go.  Self sabotage much!

(I also have to note that my errors never led to any projects fallen apart, nor did we loose any clients over my work. It was the small things that added up to the whole.)

It was a tough time because I felt like an absolute failure. My boss and my colleagues had finally discovered the ""truth"" about me...

I've been lucky to get a job relatively quickly since then as I was already looking for other roles before I was let go, but feel like the situation could end up similarly if I don't change and overcome this ASAP. I've already found myself making a few simple errors and this has triggered some anxiety again.

I'm working through some parts of it through a therapist (there's a host of other issues relating to self confidence and childhood trauma which are all connected), but not sure if I can financially sustain it in the long run.

There are a few things I have been working on to try and manage and stay in control.  For example, I'm actively trying to improve my mathematical ability regularly, keep a check list of 'must-dos', exercising regularly to manage my thoughts. Since going into the new job I've tried my best do things differently to what I did before even on simple tasks. I've told my self that it's my 'system of working' that's not working - not a fundamental judgement of my ability and self.

What I do enjoy about the job is that it gives me experience to work on interesting projects and have an impact.

My plan is to stay for a minimum of one year in this new role while I try to find something else.  At the end, perhaps I'm just not suited to this job... Or am I just having a hard time letting go? Am I really an imposter?

Any thoughts or advice to manage all of this? :) It would be really welcomed and appreciated!",Hi Im share story wondering anyone advice long post ahead apology moved new country mid 2018 job field wanted Prior move overseas pretty ok job enjoyed well enough keep going everyday entered field graduate pretty well job involves analytical thinking using number daily basis school math never forte Ive always felt sense anxiety towards number reason eg shamed front peer parental pressure etc However moved overseas got job field thing started go downhill overseas job fundamentally similar previously much complex customised work making error mistake basic stuff anxiety increased exponentially everyday felt like going revealed someone incompetent best worked really hard double triple check work cycle stress anxiety felt le confident would catastrophize every situation head eg Im going get fired get deported Coupled fact bos grammar nazi really strong eye detail lasted year half let go Self sabotage much also note error never led project fallen apart loose client work small thing added whole tough time felt like absolute failure bos colleague finally discovered truth Ive lucky get job relatively quickly since already looking role let go feel like situation could end similarly dont change overcome ASAP Ive already found making simple error triggered anxiety Im working part therapist there host issue relating self confidence childhood trauma connected sure financially sustain long run thing working try manage stay control example Im actively trying improve mathematical ability regularly keep check list mustdos exercising regularly manage thought Since going new job Ive tried best thing differently even simple task Ive told self system working thats working fundamental judgement ability self enjoy job give experience work interesting project impact plan stay minimum one year new role try find something else end perhaps Im suited job hard time letting go really imposter thought advice manage would really welcomed appreciated,trust
3547,"Hi all, I am amazed that this subreddit exists! I hope everyone is staying sane during the crisis.  

I am a medical student in the US and imposter syndrome hit me hard when I first started medical school - someone people have told me that it never really goes away so I should just find a way to deal with it through various wellness practices. 

While I still feel it now, a couple years ago I was overworking myself to the point where I was not eating all day until 8-9PM, not taking breaks, and not being social so I wanted to write a post for anyone who can relate to my experience. It took me a long time to acknowledge that I have imposter syndrome and that's totally okay, but because I realized that now I try as much as I can to not let it dictate my life. 

If you are all interested, I write more about my experiences in my blog (I have a lot of down time right now because all of our clinical work is suspended).

My parents never went to college, and I feel like I never had guidance from family about college. Entering college, I didn't even know the difference between undergraduate and graduate, or what general education requirements were, but I pulled through and graduated with my bachelor's in '16. So, I've always felt like an imposter surrounded by college kids with parents who went to college or families that were very well-educated.

Last semester, I landed a competitive internship that I am continuing this semester, but all of my colleagues and co-interns are Ivy Leaguers. I have only attended state colleges, and I have never even dreamt about Ivy League or private colleges, mostly because of the cost. 

I don't know if it is my feeling that I am imposter, or if this is real, but I always felt at my internship that people kind of look a little bit down at me for only having a public university background.

He agreed (just like that?!), and now I'm in a lab with this hot-shot prof. and a bunch of incredibly smart undergrads and grad students. As someone who got into STEM in college rather than high school, I know that I'm not up to speed with everyone else, which is why I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable about this opportunity.

3578,"What's the psychology behind Imposter Syndrome?

If I were to reply that question based on my experience with imposter syndrome, I'll say it's because I expect people to acknowledge my capabilities the way I imagine I'd have done it to someone else. But how often do I compliment someone else irl? It's quite rare that I pat on a friend or a relative's back to celebrate their accomplishments. This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.

I feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions. This is why this sort of compliments feel diluted like it's not meaningful enough to digest as truthful.

However, in real life, I work as a software developer and whenever my boss or the seniors compliment me (which rarely happens) on something I did, suddenly all of that worries instantly go away but unfortunately, it's only temporary. I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.

A potential cure?

I think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us. For me, those people are my parents, my brother, my boss, the seniors at work and a couple of colleagues in my rank. I believe that if one wants their imposter syndrome to completely go away, they're gonna have to maximise the amount of compliments they want to generate from these meaningful people. The compliment may not be physically expressed but it could also be subtle as in an increase in the respect people have for you.

In order to please those people, you're gonna have to 'git gud' in life. Work on yourself constantly, keep improving yourself. Always be active. Always ask for something to do. Try to work on the bank of knowledge of your department if you work in software. During my spare time, not only do I browse Reddit but I have tabs of research materials open. I gather knowledge which my team will need in the future and I present them during meeting.

Work your way up the hierarchy of competence and you'll notice your imposter syndrome will slowly fade away. The way people will look at you will be different. They will smile at you. They will be happy to work with you and to me, that's the one effective way to combat against that horrible, horrible thing called imposter syndrome.

I have 3 people in my life. My husband, my best friend of 18 years, and an online best friend. I don't let anyone else be my friend. I have been told that people wanted to / tried to be my friend and I made it impossible. 

I feel lonely a lot of the time. It's stupid & completly self inflicted. I think no matter how lonely I feel now, it will feel worse in the future when I lose all the friends I have. So it's easier to have as few friends as possible.

Every time I get a compliment I tell them they are wrong. Because I feel bad for them having been deceived into believing something unture, and dont want them to think me a liar or feel disappointed in the future when they find out the truth. People have actually said to me ""I'm not lying"" & ""I'm not being nasty"" after compliementing me because of how I reacted!

I am scared I will lose all 3 of my people when they realise they don't actually like me. It is easier to accept that my friend of 18 years isn't going to just change her mind (although I have no clue why she continues to be my friend), but newer friendships are so emotionally exhausting!

Even my dissertation. I just feel like I took information from organic chemistry books and websites and that I don't actually deserve any credit because if I hadn't had resources I wouldn't have been able to have done it. It's like I believe that if I didn't just *know* something without having to research it first that I don't really know it at all, even if I made sure I understood everything before I wrote about it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it. I just feel like I'm not actually an intelligent individual and I'm just really good at pretending to be. I look at other people who're graduating from the same course as me and think they must know more than me or they must actually deserve it compared to what I've been doing.

Now I'm not at uni anymore and I'm applying for jobs, I'm terrified that I'm not capable of working in the industry I've been studying for the last 3 years. The longer I spend applying for jobs and not hearing anything back, the worse I feel, because there's obviously a reason why nobody's responding to my applications.

Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn‚Äôt. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family‚Äôs and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if‚Äôs. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it‚Äôs why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I‚Äôve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what‚Äôs looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don‚Äôt look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it‚Äôs offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don‚Äôt have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We‚Äôll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don‚Äôt feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don‚Äôt treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven‚Äôt earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn‚Äôt earn it, that‚Äôs bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that‚Äôs where you go so ride it out. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don‚Äôt go down the dark hole there‚Äôs nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

3597,"I just recently had a friend put a name to what I've been experiencing the past few months, and I'd really appreciate any advice you have about overcoming imposter syndrome. 

A little about me: I started a new job about 3 months ago. I love it! I feel like I'm being challenged and a part of something awesome. Love my boss and coworkers. The problem is that I have realized how little I actually know and how often it causes me to fuck up at work. I feel like every other day my manager is confronting me about yet another mistake. 

It kind of came to a head on Monday when I not only screwed up a 2 week project, but I mishandled a piece of Very Expensive machinery. My boss told me that people have been fired for a similar mistake and next time I WILL lose my job. 

I have an advanced degree but I feel like an absolute bonehead. I know we all make mistakes, but I honestly I don't know why I haven't been fired yet. I also have anxiety which doesn't help... but man it feels like I'm not cut out for this.

3601,"I'm a 16 year old high school student in Arizona, about to enter my senior year, and I feel so far behind my peers. I feel I'm way too hard on myself, as I currently work a job and I'm ranked #5 in weighted GPA at my high school with a 4.209. That should be enough, right? Although I've tried to tell myself that I've done enough already, I couldn't feel more like a fraud. There are so many points that I could consider when telling myself I am who everyone thinks I am, but my mind comes up with very convincing counterpoints. For example, I achieved the highest ACT score of my class, where it was mandatory for all juniors to take the ACT, yet it was just a 31. Considering a 31 is the BEST ACT score IN THE JUNIOR CLASS, it makes me feel like I'm going to a school of very low academic achievement. This leads into my next point. I was just elected the president of my school's National Honors Society, but I don't feel I deserve it. The members are all extremely lazy, but I hope that changes in Senior year. I have quite a few ideas for improvements we can make to the club next year, but the running was a complete joke. In fact, I was the only student to even run for president, and I've only ever been to one event we held as a club (We''ve only ever had around 4. It was a super bad year for us.) and I hadn't even been to all of the meetings. On top of this, my SAT score is a little disappointing to me. I got a 1410. And I really don't mean for this to sound like a troll post, this is just what my brain keeps telling me. And I understand that in writing this sounds ridiculous, but it's just so rough. I wish I had done more extracurriculars while I could. I haven't done a single sport or other club save NHS and a few days of robotics club at the end of Junior year. This problem really has me considering my future, and fearing I'm going to be a failure. I feel like my GPA means nothing, especially being from one of the lowest ranked states as far as academics go. This is really just a vent post, as I understand it may sound ridiculous, but I just feel like I don't deserve any of the stuff I have, like I've just been really lucky to get good test scores but in reality I'm super unintelligent.

3602,"I‚Äôm so beyond grateful for the support of my family, friends, and boyfriend and their words of congratulations to me. A small part of me thinks ‚Äúyeah I did that, I accomplished it,‚Äù but the bigger part of me doesn‚Äôt know why I feel nothing.

My time as a piano major was extremely stressful, not in the academic way but in a personal way that was tied to my professors. After graduating from my two year college, my private instructor there cut me off completely. It was confusing because we were so close, she was someone I told everything to. My last conversation with her, I revealed to her that my sister was taken by CPS and I was diagnosed with RA. I tried to follow up with her but she never responded. I don‚Äôt resent her for it, I‚Äôm still very confused and hurt that after 2-3 years of talking to her almost everyday, she refused to say hello or even ask how I was doing after transferring to university.

Almost immediately after moving away from family to continue my studies, I learned about my sister and CPS and it impacted my ability to focus or perform, which is huge since I was literally a performance major and I was performing every week. I thought I had gained trust with one of my piano professors, so I told him what was going on. He was so supportive until my last day of class when he told me how disappointed he was in my final class performance but that he would still give me an A out of pity for me. That should‚Äôve made me feel grateful but I felt so humiliated. In my last year at university, my new private lesson instructor made me feel like I had learned nothing while at school, saying I wouldn‚Äôt pass my recital hearing (basically a test to see if I‚Äôm ready to perform my senior recital) and even threatening my graduation date. He would also say things like ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt made any progress‚Äù but in the same breath tell me I‚Äôve come a long way, which confused me. Small things like that added up to an entire list, most of which is made up of negative commentary.

Now I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I deserve only praise. I‚Äôm well aware that I‚Äôm not a prodigy and that I‚Äôm not going to make a career out of performing because it‚Äôs not something I feel I have the constitution for. Sure, I enjoy the occasional performance especially in front of audiences that are supportive and want to hear what I have to share. I actually just had my debut in Colombia in April where I got to teach a masterclass and then perform in the concert hall in front of 500 people. They were so incredibly kind and they are still reaching out to me to tell me how much they loved hearing me play.

So why, after seeing my own progress and being happy with how I progressed, especially as someone in a field where there are so many incredible and inspiring musicians, do I feel like I didn‚Äôt do what I was supposed to? I used to be so proud of the music I shared because I genuinely felt like I was meant to do this, but then hearing these professors who used to attend Juilliard and Curtis and had well-established careers that I‚Äôm a disappointment made me feel like no matter how hard I try, I‚Äôll never be worthy of praise. And now that I have my degree, all I can think about is the pain associated with my years at college.

3605,"In university I ended up getting into my highly competitive dream faculty through a diversity slot. At the time my GPA was still competitive I felt guilty about taking this space up but my parents and family all encouraged me to apply. We had money saved for my schooling and I have not really been impacted by anything related to my race or poverty etc. (we are one generation out of poverty). I got in with the lowest accepted GPA in my very small class. School was rough, but no exams were failed aside from one where I was pushed through for being 1/5th of a percentage point off from passing the class, and this was common in my program for profs to find extra half marks in their work for kids who were close to the next letter grade. Now that I am graduated and in my career I am good at my job, I keep trying to improve and demonstrate good work ethic, I love my job and my co workers appreciate me for what I bring to the table. But I still think every day that this is not something I earned. What can I do to deal with this feeling? Do I need to find a new career and earn it by merit or should I just focus on being as good of a professional as I can in my current career?

3615,"I didn't always have the self-esteem to claim that I was an intelligent person, but throughout my childhood, adolescence, and early youth, I did have some flashes of brilliance that made me feel confident in my abilities.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

Due to my grades I thought it would be difficult for me to find a job, but I quickly got a position as an engineer, and two years later I am still in the same company where I have a position with a high technical profile.

In my day to day I obviously interact with my team, where at the level of academic trajectory, I am clearly at the bottom, if not in the last place. It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

Where I want to get at is that I feel like I ended up here by sheer miracle or by a whim of fate. If I have to be honest, I get to understand the concepts that I work on, but I feel that sometimes it is more difficult for me than others.

3616,"Hi everyone! I am new here. So, I was on a law students reddit page a while ago and came across the term Imposter Syndrome. I got curious and googled the term. After that, I searched and took Imposter Syndrome quizzes online (I know its not reliable but I just want to see how I fair) and turns out that every single one of the quizzes I took said I have a high tendency or possibility of having Imposter Syndrome.

Looking back, I think I identify with the signs of having it. I have been an achiever since I was a kid. I was a consistent Honors Student (Straight As) from Elementary to High School. In college, I did well too. I was consistent Deans List and graduated Cum Laude. I was Managing Editor of our College Newspaper and competed and won regional and national titles in Journalism competitions. 

Went to law school and did fairly well again. Took the bar only once and passed. I was a lawyer before I was 30. 

My whole life I was expected to accomplish high feats. People see me as an achiever. But to be honest, I dont see myself as such. I always think that I might be good but someone will always be better than me. I always think that I should have accomplished more rn at my age but i havent. I feel like all other friends, classmates I had have already come a long way.

I feel like whenever I make a mistake, people starts talkingbehind my back and talk/gossip abt me not being good at what I do. I feel like all the accolades and hardwork I did doesnt really make me capable. I dont like talking abt my achievements or being complimented coz I feel embarrassed. I just wanted to be lowkey. I remember passing the bar and when I was congratulated I said I was just lucky. 

I thought all these are just normal and a part of me being the introvert that I am. But when I came across the term ""Imposter Syndrome"" and read abt it felt like a glass shattered (like in HIMYM episode called ""Spoiler Alert"" lol) and it all kind of become clearer to me. I dont know who to talk to abt this so I looked for a group here on reddit hoping to get to discuss or maybe help me understand abt this more.

P.S. Im so sorry for the long ass post.

3617,"Hi, 
I‚Äôve been feeling a sense that I don‚Äôt belong at my firm anymore for quite a while. I got a small promotion and more work given to me and it feels like I‚Äôve fumbled my way thru it all. My senior management doesn‚Äôt inform me of mistakes I‚Äôve made anymore and instead they they just fix themselves. My manager doesn‚Äôt really speak to me anymore besides I‚Äôm teams when something is needed. And recently a team member was let go for underperforming. 

My problem is that i think I‚Äôm in the same boat as the the coworker who recently was let go. I feel as tho I underperform even tho I work late almost everyday and soon I‚Äôll be let go too. It takes me longer to do work which in accounting is how we charge the client. If I run up a budget we lose money and I worry about it all the time. I‚Äôm trying to to study for the cpa on top of keeping whatever work life balance I can and I just honestly can‚Äôt keep up anymore.

Need some advice on how to deal with this. Minor panic attacks have started so I definitely need some sort of help.

3618,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day.

3623,"The dictionary defines self-awareness as ‚Äúknowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.‚Äù 

When you‚Äôre self-aware, you have an accurate and clear understanding of your character, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs and sense of self. You know what your life is about, you know how others perceive you and the effect you have on them.

Why does it matter?

Your level of self-awareness influences the key pillars in your life ‚Äì your relationships, career, personal development and overall wellbeing.

¬∑ Self-awareness is necessary for taking control of your life. The direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and reactions. Self-awareness is the principal way of understanding and influencing these things. When you take control, you have choices.

¬∑ Self-awareness identifies un-resourceful beliefs and emotional reactions that stand in your way and gives you the power to make adjustments ‚Äì personal growth.

¬∑ Self-awareness can lead to a greater understanding of past setbacks and challenges. We can conveniently dismiss our failures as bad luck or a lack of proper timing. But it‚Äôs also possible that we failed to perceive the situation, others, or ourselves accurately. It‚Äôs much easier to see the reason behind relationship, work, and other struggles when we can look at ourselves honestly.

¬∑ Self-awareness is critical for successful leadership. Leaders with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses are able to build teams that compensate those weaknesses and leverage the strengths.

¬∑ Self-awareness is the foundation for personal growth. Without it, any personal development efforts will be severely hampered ‚Äì as if you‚Äôre building on sand.  
   
 

# How Can I Develop Self-Awareness?

¬∑ **Develop the habit of Noticing your thoughts.** Our minds are constantly churning through ideas and endlessly providing commentary. Becoming aware of these thoughts, and noticing the common themes gives the potential for encouraging more resourceful self-talk.

‚óã Notice your thinking patterns. What are you thinking when you‚Äôre feeling nervous? Bored? Interested? Walking down the street? ‚Äì what does this mean for you?

‚óã Do you judge people and situations? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future? Do you expect the worst to happen or the best? Or do you adopt an open attitude of, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just see what happens‚Äù?

¬∑ **Notice your feelings.** What are you feeling throughout the day? What do you feel while you‚Äôre eating? Driving to work? Lying in bed? Waiting in line?

‚óã As you notice each emotion, question it. What am I feeling? Why? What do I need right now? How do I normally react in this situation? Is this resourceful for me? 

¬∑ **Reflect on how you deal with frustration or emotional discomfort.** ***A huge chunk of your time is spent trying to make yourself feel better.*** If you feel slightly frustrated or uncomfortable, then you may spend a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to change the situation or the others around you to resolve those negative feelings. Would id be more resourceful to develop your responses ‚Äì which you can control ‚Äì or try to change others ‚Äì who you do not control. 

‚óã Do you try to control others? Do you attempt to distract yourself? Is your first instinct to leave the situation? Do you surf the internet or eat a big bowl of ice cream?

¬∑ **Consider your friendships.** Where do you meet new friends? Are most of your friendships long-term or short? When your friendships end, what is the common cause? What types of people do you prefer to be friends with? What types of people do you avoid?

¬∑ **Consider your intimate relationships.** Do you see patterns in the type of people that you‚Äôve been involved with? What are the common positive and negative characteristics they share? Why do you think those people appealed to you?

‚óã What were your shortcomings in your relationships? Are you clingy? Jealous? Too focused on work? Fail to communicate your needs? Think about how you contributed to the successes and failure of your relationships.

‚óã Have you changed your approach from relationship to relationship, or do you continue to repeat the same patterns?

¬∑ **Keep a journal.** This is a highly effective way to learn about yourself by recording your thoughts, feelings, and experiences each day. Be sure to include your high and low points for the day.

‚óã Note how well you ate and slept, too. Sleep ‚Äì especially changes in sleeping patterns - can elicit very valuable information about what is going on. 

‚óã Create a habit of writing in your journal for at least 15 minutes each day. You‚Äôll start to notice patterns and learn a lot about yourself.

¬∑ **Reflect on your core values.** Think about and then document your core values, goals and intentions. You might be surprised by what you write. This is a great first step for understanding yourself and your beliefs.

¬∑ **Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses.** How do you know? Are you certain? Avoid jumping to conclusions. You may have always believed that you‚Äôre a hard worker, but are you? To whom are you comparing yourself? Provide yourself with proof before you make any decisions. Are you noticing any limiting beliefs ‚Äì I‚Äôm not good enough, I‚Äôm not worthy?

¬∑ **What would others say about you?** Consider how your partner, children, friends, family, co-workers, and boss would describe you. What would they suggest you improve about yourself? How do you respond to thinking about what others think about you?

¬∑ **Trance.** Meditation is all about developing a better awareness of the present moment and yourself. *Meditation is an ideal activity for enhancing self-awareness. Hypnosis / Self-hypnosis is all about using the trance state to support your general wellbeing and specific outcomes.*

‚óã Meditate at least once each day. Spend the rest of the day paying attention to yourself, others, and your surroundings. You can develop a higher degree of self-awareness by just paying attention.

‚óã Question yourself throughout the day.  *‚ÄúWhat emotions am I currently feeling and why?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are the people around me feeling?‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äôwhat is the best use of my time right now?‚Äô‚Äô*",dictionary defines selfawareness ‚Äú knowledge awareness personality character ‚Äù ‚Äô selfaware accurate clear understanding character strength weakness value belief sense self know life know others perceive effect matter level selfawareness influence key pillar life ‚Äì relationship career personal development overall wellbeing ¬∑ Selfawareness necessary taking control life direction life determined thought belief emotion reaction Selfawareness principal way understanding influencing thing take control choice ¬∑ Selfawareness identifies unresourceful belief emotional reaction stand way give power make adjustment ‚Äì personal growth ¬∑ Selfawareness lead greater understanding past setback challenge conveniently dismiss failure bad luck lack proper timing ‚Äô also possible failed perceive situation others accurately ‚Äô much easier see reason behind relationship work struggle look honestly ¬∑ Selfawareness critical successful leadership Leaders understanding strength weakness able build team compensate weakness leverage strength ¬∑ Selfawareness foundation personal growth Without personal development effort severely hampered ‚Äì ‚Äô building sand Develop SelfAwareness ¬∑ Develop habit Noticing thought mind constantly churning idea endlessly providing commentary Becoming aware thought noticing common theme give potential encouraging resourceful selftalk ‚óã Notice thinking pattern thinking ‚Äô feeling nervous Bored Interested Walking street ‚Äì mean ‚óã judge people situation spend lot time thinking past future expect worst happen best adopt open attitude ‚Äú Let ‚Äô see happens ‚Äù ¬∑ Notice feeling feeling throughout day feel ‚Äô eating Driving work Lying bed Waiting line ‚óã notice emotion question feeling need right normally react situation resourceful ¬∑ Reflect deal frustration emotional discomfort huge chunk time spent trying make feel better feel slightly frustrated uncomfortable may spend tremendous amount time energy trying change situation others around resolve negative feeling Would id resourceful develop response ‚Äì control ‚Äì try change others ‚Äì control ‚óã try control others attempt distract first instinct leave situation surf internet eat big bowl ice cream ¬∑ Consider friendship meet new friend friendship longterm short friendship end common cause type people prefer friend type people avoid ¬∑ Consider intimate relationship see pattern type people ‚Äô involved common positive negative characteristic share think people appealed ‚óã shortcoming relationship clingy Jealous focused work Fail communicate need Think contributed success failure relationship ‚óã changed approach relationship relationship continue repeat pattern ¬∑ Keep journal highly effective way learn recording thought feeling experience day sure include high low point day ‚óã Note well ate slept Sleep ‚Äì especially change sleeping pattern elicit valuable information going ‚óã Create habit writing journal least 15 minute day ‚Äô start notice pattern learn lot ¬∑ Reflect core value Think document core value goal intention might surprised write great first step understanding belief ¬∑ Reflect strength weakness know certain Avoid jumping conclusion may always believed ‚Äô hard worker comparing Provide proof make decision noticing limiting belief ‚Äì ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô worthy ¬∑ would others say Consider partner child friend family coworkers bos would describe would suggest improve respond thinking others think ¬∑ Trance Meditation developing better awareness present moment Meditation ideal activity enhancing selfawareness Hypnosis Selfhypnosis using trance state support general wellbeing specific outcome ‚óã Meditate least day Spend rest day paying attention others surroundings develop higher degree selfawareness paying attention ‚óã Question throughout day ‚Äú emotion currently feeling ‚Äù ‚Äú people around feeling ‚Äù ‚Äò ‚Äô best use time right ‚Äô ‚Äô,trust

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

¬∑ Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‚ÄòBecause I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others‚Äô or ‚ÄòI choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other‚Äôs accomplishments‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards‚Äô. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as ‚Äì by its very nature ‚Äì it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‚Äòus‚Äô and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",think ‚Äô belong think ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô fraud getting idea station ‚Äô worthy really Sound familiar Welcome Imposter Syndrome ‚Äô good company Nigella Lawson Michelle Obama Lady GaGa Lily Allen shared imposter syndrome experience publicly demon ‚Äô umbrella term life one limiting belief generalised one may accompanied specific belief typically formed rationally childhood child may serve u well example ¬∑ need everyone approve ¬∑ valued must succeed everything ¬∑ OK make mistake bad ¬∑ feel happy life without contributing back way ¬∑ Everyone need rely someone stronger ¬∑ ‚Äô feel sadness discomfort pain ¬∑ Someone somewhere take responsibility would list look like However time move thing change become adult childhood belief serve u le well ‚Äì resultant behaviour may incongruent situation lead conclusion one thing mean grow develop childhood belief adopt new set belief serve u better adult progression follows broad pattern developing dependence child independence young adult interdependence mature adult overall set belief developing time However u carry childhood belief u adulthood innocuous time sometimes impede performance high functioning interdependent adult adult benefit identifying limiting belief growing valuable belief way example common limiting belief sitting Imposter Syndrome umbrella ‚Äò must compare others ‚Äô reframed ‚Äò live life term ‚Äô ‚Äò unique set character strength others ‚Äô turn reframed belief underpin valuable affirmation ‚Äò live life enjoy success others ‚Äô ‚Äò choose celebrate success without reference ‚Äô accomplishment ‚Äô ‚Äò fact choose live life authentically mean compare standard ‚Äô standard element working PERMA hypnotherapy developing high degree selfawareness via exploring character strength value belief limiting belief pave way defining identity turn leaf ideally placed choose best future Working hypnotherapist particularly well suited personal development area ‚Äì nature ‚Äì open pathway part know recognise ‚Äò u ‚Äô deeper level wisdom ideal need take big step forward,trust
3628,"Hi everyone,

I (fairly) recently got promoted at work, and I‚Äôve been really struggling with what I‚Äôm assuming is imposter‚Äôs syndrome ever since. :( I‚Äôm finding it really really hard. 

My job is research based, originally I was doing more admin tasks and I was quite happy and confident in what I was doing. After my promotion I became more directly involved with conducting the research itself. It‚Äôs a big change in my role and the day-to-day activities in my job.

When I went for the promotion, I kind of worried this would happen. I‚Äôm a people pleaser, I suffer with social anxiety and OCD, so I did think that this might be too much for me, but there was pressure to go for it from colleagues, friends, family etc. I thought getting promoted would look good to others and therefore make me feel better about myself :( 

However now I‚Äôm stuck in the job and I‚Äôm just really struggling. We have deadlines, so I feel like I‚Äôm constantly rushing to finish things. When I rush, I get stressed because the quality of my work isn‚Äôt as good as I feel it should be. I worry there are mistakes that I don‚Äôt have time to rectify, then I worry that the mistakes mean I‚Äôm not good enough to be in this role. I‚Äôm also slower because I meticulously check everything for errors, which I worry doesn‚Äôt look good for my performance, further proving to myself that I don‚Äôt deserve this job. Generally I‚Äôm worried my lack of knowledge is going to be revealed somehow, that there will be some huge problem with my work that I won‚Äôt spot because I‚Äôm not intelligent enough etc. I then worry I‚Äôll get fired from my job. 

I think this is all kind of linked to the OCD. The perfectionism, the meticulous checking like I just can‚Äôt let go. I‚Äôve always struggled with these things, but the imposter‚Äôs syndrome has never been as bad as this. I dread getting up and going to work now, whereas I never used to mind it. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my boss about the struggles a little, but I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself and don‚Äôt want to admit how hard I‚Äôm finding it. 

Does anyone relate to this? Any tips on making it more bearable? I‚Äôm feeling really useless at the moment :(

For some reason, despite this, she would still fly into a rage at me whenever my teacher would call to complain that I wasn't doing well in school (idk how or why she could hold these two opposing attitudes at the same time and yet she did). So basically at any given time she was either love bombing me because of my imaginary brilliance, raging at me because of my failures, or neglecting me.

3631,"Hello I am new here M (24). I have been a poor student ever since I can remember. I failed 5 grade (who fails 5th grade ffs?). I am not a poor learner or stupid by any means but I was never able to get even average grades. A lot of which had to do with the nature of my dad‚Äôs job. We moved around a lot, including abroad where I lacked proper schooling.

11 and 12 grade are super important in our country because they decide the university you will get in. I was so badly prepared for 11 that I decided to repeat. And when I repeated I failed. I had zero hope of getting anywhere.

But still I applied to every university possible. I knew that would only get into shitty ones. But by an absolute stroke of luck I got into a very good university (top 5 or something). I had an excellent entrance test score somehow and I forgot my result card so they just assumed I passed 11th grade (which I later did but not at the time). Very lucky.

University life was super tough for me. I had to study twice as hard as other to get half the results others were getting. I was so very close to failing multiple courses every semester but somehow I always managed to pass by slimiest of margins. My GPA was only 2.58/4 (that too thanks to COVID) but I graduated in 4 years. Very lucky again.

I started applying for jobs before my last semester even began. I was starting to see how my low GPA was holding me back. Everyone who started applying after me got the jobs they wanted. I was left behind. Felt extremely bad but I kept looking. 

My cousin referred me to a Big 4 firm. They don‚Äôt hire from our university, they only hire CPA or ACCA and i was just a Bsc student. The hiring process is also very tough. Tests and interviews. I gave my best and somehow I cleared it all. Turns out they were very short staffed so they made an exception for me. Very lucky again.

Its been 3 months and the job is going fine. But I do feel dumb compared to others as their knowledge is way more then me. I still do my best, I always pretend that I know shit when in reality I don‚Äôt. I constantly live in this fear that one day I will be exposed and it will all come crumbling down. They will know I just got into university by luck, i got into the firm by luck. In reality I don‚Äôt have the credentials for this job. I failed 5th grade, I failed 11th twice, i hardly passed university.

On the other hand many people who know me believe that i got into university and the firm because my father is somewhat influential. That is absolutely not the case. He dint even know I applied to these place till I got in.

I'm so scared that people will find out I'm lying, even though I know I'm not? Does that make sense?

3636,"This is my first time posting here.
I, 34M, am highly doubting my work competences.
I‚Äôve been reading about imposter and think this is what I have.

Let me give background. I come from a family of High intellectual potentials. Although never tested, both my sisters are diagnosed.
I am very sensitive to the opinion of others.

In school, I always succeeded with little effort. I never hid that I did not work and got many jealousy as a result. So I hid my grades.
In university, I got great grades while my gf, now wife, had a harder time, although we studied the same. (She made the schedule).

I‚Äôm quite sure I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten my degree without her planning.

After my master, I did a PhD, got praise from the jury. But if you ask me, I‚Äôll tell you my research wasn‚Äôt worth it, it contributed 0 to science and only got published because my supervisor was good at writing.

I did a Postdoc but then completely changed field.
I felt inadequate in that job, that I wasn‚Äôt properly qualified for it.
During my postdoc, I passed a teacher certification, which was easy. 
I couldn‚Äôt continue the classes, so I ended up going straight for the jury and received the certification, thanks to my good memories from the previous year lesson.

I did not start working as a teacher, I did something completely different still.
I‚Äôve been doing that job for 3 years. I started mid 2019 and we soon had Covid. I have been unable to resume ‚Äúas before‚Äù. I feel like nothing I do makes a difference so I avoid doing. I‚Äôm failing this job and my boss will soon figure it out. Although so far no one said I was doing an inappropriate job.

I then requested to change position in August. And am transitioning positions currently.

Todays, had a progress meeting and was only told I need to make sure I plan and prioritize better. I know this is a weakness I have. I‚Äôm too ¬´¬†hot¬†¬ª, in the moment.

I procrastinate until last minute and then rush to finish. Mostly because tasks seem impossible. And am not happy because the result is not exactly as I imagined it.

Now I‚Äôm lost.
Is it imposter, am I just incompetent, am I really not organized enough, am I just too perfectionist?
I feel like I‚Äôm exaggerating thinking it‚Äôs imposter.

I‚Äôm thinking of seeking help, but first, how do you tell your wife you feel like a failure undeserving of your position?

3641,"It occurred to me earlier today that this is an opportunity to prove to myself that I‚Äôm not an imposter and I can and should be doing this job, but the truth is I don‚Äôt believe that and I can‚Äôt stop freaking out about it. 

I always get nervous about presentations and talks but this is a whole other level. I‚Äôve been feeling sick and dizzy since I agreed to it (why oh why did I agree to it - oh yeah, because if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd feel like an even bigger imposter), I‚Äôve had a tension headache for a few days now, last night I woke up the pain was so bad, and it‚Äôs like my whole body is just really tense all the time and I have this constant sense of dread that I cannot shake.

Maybe I have anxiety. If I don‚Äôt feel better after the presentation I‚Äôll go to the GP.

I think what‚Äôs making it worse is it‚Äôs with my boss (or in front of him) and I already feel like he made a mistake hiring me and I‚Äôm not the person he thought I was. I wasn‚Äôt going to apply because I thought it was too much of a step up for me, but my recruiter talked me into it, and by some miracle I did well in the interview. Normally I‚Äôm bad at interviews but know I can do the job. This time it was like I became one of those people who interviews well but doesn‚Äôt really have what it takes to deliver.

It‚Äôs also probably the most objectively important presentation I‚Äôve ever had to do.

I‚Äôve never messed up a presentation before, in fact people have even complimented me on them in the past (I think they‚Äôre pleasantly surprised because I make no secret of how much I hate doing them - to colleagues, not the people I‚Äôm presenting to), but I can‚Äôt help thinking this is the one I‚Äôm going to mess up. It doesn‚Äôt help that my many practice runs still aren‚Äôt great and don‚Äôt seem to be getting better. It especially doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm going to be presenting on Teams, which I‚Äôve never done before, and our whole IT system is changing tomorrow. 

The sad thing is, even if I have another miracle and it goes well tomorrow, I know that won‚Äôt be enough for me to believe I‚Äôm not an imposter and I can and should do this job. I‚Äôll just pass it off as a fluke or dismiss it as inconsequential. There‚Äôs always another way I could fail - another way I have to prove myself.

3646,"The title summarises most of this but basically, I get a lot of compliments from people. Like a lot a lot. I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre.

3647,"I‚Äôll try to make this quick. I‚Äôm a 20 year old birth doula. If you don‚Äôt know what that means, it‚Äôs a female-only non-medical support career for women giving birth. I‚Äôm trained in physical comfort measures, methods such as hypnobirthing, mediation/emotional support, and advocacy for my clients‚Äô decisions about their labor and birth.

This is a field that has just recently started to grow in popularity, and despite how simple it may sound, certification is a long, hard process. I‚Äôm extremely passionate about the importance of birth and how the idea of it has been corrupted to seem like a medical emergency in every scenario, and modern hospitals routinely abuse mothers in labor. My desire to change this has kept me going for 2 years. I‚Äôm completely trained, yet still uncertified due to the last steps being hands-on experience among other things. The pandemic has kept doulas out of hospitals, making it extremely difficult to find clients for my 3 certifying births, especially as a brand new doula. 

Recently, I‚Äôve taken some steps that have finally led 3 clients to contact me. I‚Äôm aware that all three are mostly interested in my low fee, which is less than a third of what experienced and certified doulas charge. Regardless, I need these 3 births to get certified and begin growing my practice. 

Working with a doula client involves both gathering all information about their pregnancy, birth history, desires for their birth plan, and health information, as well as educating the client on certain decisions, comfort measures, procedures, and birth physiology. There are generally two prenatal meetings preceding the birth and one postpartum meeting afterwords. I‚Äôve held two meetings for different clients. 

It‚Äôs overwhelming having little guidance while jumping into such a large career. No one tells you how to run a prenatal meeting. Your textbook knowledge has to be accurate and unbiased. You have to be intuitive to a laboring woman‚Äôs needs when she can‚Äôt express them verbally. You need to be an expert at active listening and mediation without any personal input or advice.   You need to have thick skin and be open to rejection and criticism from doctors, nurses, clients, other doulas, midwives, and close-minded people who believe there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright‚Äù way to give birth. 

With the lack of support, training, and insight, I slaved over creating an itinerary with minuscule help from Google and a few of my birth books before I ran my first meeting. This is where it gets tough. I know the meeting went well, but I still went home and cried. No matter how much I prepare or how well I know I‚Äôve done, I can‚Äôt make myself believe I actually belong here. After my second meeting, I was 100% convinced that the couple wanted nothing to do with me. That they‚Äôd opted out of wanting a doula after all and they would just ghost me. Of course, this was not the case but it seemed so real in my head. 

At one point, I made an Instagram post about the importance of skin to skin contact directly after birth to meet my ‚Äúone social media post per month‚Äù quota for a local doula group I‚Äôm in. A midwife dm‚Äôd me, disagreeing with a claim I made about newborn discomfort in the birth canal. I‚Äôd read about this fact before and it was even brought up in my initial doula training. I was sure I was correct, yet I was sent into one of the worst spirals of self-hatred of my life. I‚Äôd never felt so incompetent. My thoughts had never been scarier. I was convinced that everyone I had status with had seen the post and disagreed with it and I was now the laughing stalk of the area. I then pinned this idea to the itinerary of an upcoming meeting with my doula group, and I was convinced one of the topics was added because of my post. I emailed the leader of the group (actually it turns out I emailed THE ENTIRE BOARD) with a panicked message about how sorry I was. She had no idea what I was talking about and I completely humiliated myself as a new, inexperienced member.

Just today, I received a text from a client saying she was checking into an appointment with her midwife that I had agreed to attend. I‚Äôd forgotten to put it on my calendar, and I was currently tied up with one of my 3 other jobs, which was nannying my infant nieces. I had to explain the situation and apologize profusely and I could tell she wasn‚Äôt impressed. I‚Äôve been thrown between beating myself up and distracting myself all day.

Somehow, every time I move forward, I feel like absolute shit. Every time I make a mistake I feel like absolute shit. Every single thing I do makes me want to give it all up because I can never ever be good enough. People tell me I‚Äôm born for this field and it‚Äôs my calling. This is genuinely my dream career and I want to believe them. Everyone says that every doula is important because we all offer different skills and personality traits. I want to know I‚Äôm not just the one exception to that. I‚Äôm working my ass off and pouring so much time and money into getting my life started, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm good enough. I hate this feeling so much. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and confidently learn from my mistakes, but both just make me hate myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been in therapy and I‚Äôve done all the natural mental health support I can do and nothings changing. I‚Äôm terrified for when I actually support my first birth (I‚Äôve attended two as a shadow to an experienced doula but never been the primary.)

3650,"I'm a wedding photographer in the UK and have done it since around 2014. I started by doing a few friends weddings and it grew from there to where I now have almost 50 weddings a year.  

I used to really enjoy the job and my work but the more I do it, the faker I feel and the more I worry. I feel that I've marketed myself really well rather than people booking me for my work itself. I feel that I have a fairly realistic idea of how good I am at wedding photography and while I wouldn't put myself at the very bottom, I know I have a long way to go before I would ever like my own work.   

A couple who live in Canada found my Instagram and have booked me for their wedding in France which is happening in a weeks time. I have never felt more like a fraud in my entire life. The pressure is huge. They are paying me to go to France to take their wedding photos. This is now no longer that I just happen to be a local wedding photographer who knows a local venue well.... this is now a case where someone has found me and could have picked anyone in the entire UK or most of Europe! Why me? My work really isn't that good! It's average at best. I rarely even post on Instagram so I don't even know how they came across my page.   

The pressure of photographing their wedding and delivering their images is now weighing so heavy on my shoulders. I'm already going through a mental battle right now with medical testing for what could be a serious life-threatening disease. The added pressure of now having to go to France next week to photograph a wedding is huge.    

I don't even get much feedback from couples anymore either. I used to send off the photos and they would email me back telling me how much they love their photos and then would write a review. I've not had that much recently. I send the photos off and hear absolutely nothing from them ever again. So naturally I ruminate and think that they dislike their images. I keep wondering if I'm doing something different than I used to or if I've become complacent but I'm not so sure. I put in so much effort on my wedding days.  

I don't know. I just have no confidence at all at the moment and the lack of that and feedback makes me want to quit.... but what other job could I do to earn this sort of money and only work 1 day a week??

3656,"So my understanding of imposter syndrome is pretty limited but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve developed it.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I‚Äôve done good. I‚Äôve made mistakes, gotten subpar marks like everyone else but I was almost always able to pull it together when it mattered - GCSEs, A Levels, uni exams and assignments. This last year, the last year of my Bachelor‚Äôs, I seemed to be on track for a First, with me pulling myself through assignments with First-class marks.

And then I didn‚Äôt do good enough on my project to progress to the undergraduate Master‚Äôs program.

I have a poor habit of procrastinating to all shit and then cramming my way through the last couple weeks to come out the other side with good marks. It‚Äôs always worked well for me so I had no real reason to stop. I guess I thought I could do the same here but nope.

Now I‚Äôm looking back on everything I‚Äôve done well and it feels like a fluke, a fraud, that I was just lucky and wasn‚Äôt really worthy of the good marks and grades given to me. I‚Äôve always been able to pull it together when it mattered but this is when it mattered the most and I didn‚Äôt do good enough.

People are saying that a 2:1 Bachelor‚Äôs is still good enough but I can‚Äôt say how much shame I‚Äôve felt around it.

3658,"Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this forum. I basically wanted to vent some stuff I've had on my mind the past weekend. So, I graduated recently with my bachelor's in statistics in early May, and I have been job hunting since then until literally a few days ago. I managed to finally get what I would have considered my ""dream job"", a data analyst position at a big company with great benefits and a fantastic starting salary. I truly couldn't believe it when I got the call back that I had finally gotten the job offer after having interviewed countless times and even being rejected once from another company I really wanted to work with.

Now, I struggle with incredibly low self-esteem in general. Although I graduated with the top of my class and had a near 4.0 grade point average, I still considered myself less than adequate for one reason: I had very little relevant work experience. I knew some programming languages sure as was required by my school coursework, but because I was a commuter student I wasn't involved in any fancy professional clubs/orgs, I had no internships in the field to speak of, and when I originally graduated, I was terrified I'd end up in a terrible job I didn't want doing something I was going to be bad at because all I really know how to do was study hard, learn really hard math, and get good grades.

I was and still am shocked as hell I managed to actually get my foot in the door as an official business analyst doing what I had originally went to college to do. But I feel like that initial anxiety I had still hasn't gone away. Now, I'm worried about basically ""fucking it up"". I didn't lie to them about knowing technologies I didn't know, it was obvious from my resume and the stories I chose to tell to them during my interviews that I had no internship experience and was basically a brand new freshie.

I basically just tried to convince them that I knew how to analyze datasets and math and could communicate difficult concepts to people. Which, honestly, I believe I can do. But at the same time, I'm not an expert by any means in any of the softwares I have used. In college, when given the choice to do something with software or by hand, I almost always did it by hand because I just preferred that, and I learned better doing that.

So I guess basically I'm wondering if what I'm going through is the dreaded imposter syndrome I've always heard about in fields such as these. I always felt deep down that I wasn't good enough, and I was shocked anyone decided to give me a chance at all. Part of me wants to tell myself that if they thought I wasn't going to be able to do the job, they wouldn't have hired me. I was a first-generation college student, no one has ever done a job like I'm doing in my family, and I literally have no frame of reference. I feel like I'm in undiscovered territory, and I have no idea what my first day is going to be like and what my manager is going to expect from me for the first few weeks. I just don't want to let anybody down, and I want to be what I have to be. What should I do?",Hi first time Ive posted forum basically wanted vent stuff Ive mind past weekend graduated recently bachelor statistic early May job hunting since literally day ago managed finally get would considered dream job data analyst position big company great benefit fantastic starting salary truly couldnt believe got call back finally gotten job offer interviewed countless time even rejected another company really wanted work struggle incredibly low selfesteem general Although graduated top class near 40 grade point average still considered le adequate one reason little relevant work experience knew programming language sure required school coursework commuter student wasnt involved fancy professional clubsorgs internship field speak originally graduated terrified Id end terrible job didnt want something going bad really know study hard learn really hard math get good grade still shocked hell managed actually get foot door official business analyst originally went college feel like initial anxiety still hasnt gone away Im worried basically fucking didnt lie knowing technology didnt know obvious resume story chose tell interview internship experience basically brand new freshie basically tried convince knew analyze datasets math could communicate difficult concept people honestly believe time Im expert mean software used college given choice something software hand almost always hand preferred learned better guess basically Im wondering Im going dreaded imposter syndrome Ive always heard field always felt deep wasnt good enough shocked anyone decided give chance Part want tell thought wasnt going able job wouldnt hired firstgeneration college student one ever done job like Im family literally frame reference feel like Im undiscovered territory idea first day going like manager going expect first week dont want let anybody want,trust

I believe this to be very true and I can back it up with evidence throughout the most recent years of my life in specific.

3675,"I just finished my second semester of online grad school for counseling and it was ROUGH. I took Counseling Techniques this semester and we do recording assignments to show our proficiency of skills. I did okay throughout the semester, but on the last assignment, I tanked. The Professor said that the assignment I submitted does not show the required level of competency in these skills. I have a passing grade in the class, but I wouldn't be surprised if I am still forced to retake it. 

I feel upset and stupid. I've had these feelings pop up throughout my two semesters. Also, in other classes, where I felt like I didn't belong. I want this career. I want to be a therapist, but maybe I do not have what it takes to be one. There are some things that you can learn and change within yourself and there are some things that you just can't. I'm not sure if this is something that I can change. 

Like the title says, I'm not sure if this is imposter Syndrome from seeing a reflection of my fear of failing, or a wake-up call that I'm not meant or cut out for this work. I even considered other possible career options in different directions. 

At this point, I am frustrated, upset, and concerned about my future. I also feel stupid if I ended up wasting my time and money not only in this grad school but also in my undergrad. I love psychology and will advocate for mental health always, but I'm starting to think that that is not enough. That loving the subject and dreaming about a career in that field is not enough. I'm starting to think that I chose the wrong career path and now I am stuck. I'm starting to wish for a redo on life to make sure that I pick right this time. 

I also think that COVID had a heavy hand with this. Before COVID, I was very motivated and ready to go, but lately, with the way that the world is, I'm not sure why I was so motivated. Or for what?

3676,"This is my first post here. I'm sorry if I break any rules.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone. Even though I know that I suffer from imposter syndrome, (I'm in therapy for this and other reasons), I TRUELY believe that what I'm doing is bad and that I am stupid. People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

Update: I handed it in last week!! The only thought that kept me going was ""It doesn't matter if it's bad. Just finish it somehow."" I couldn't convince myself that what I doing was good.

Today, during a meeting, my boss asked me if I wanted my boss to run through my department's numbers or if I was OK doing it. I offered to do it just so I could get more familiar. It's my NINTH day, so of course I don't have it all down pat, and it showed. But guess what? They were still pleased. And then they moved on.

My little voice cropped up saying, ""You idiot - see? Now they all know you're a phony."" But I stopped myself and quickly rewrote the narrative - I was asked to do something on the spot I hadn't been prepped for, given the option to not do it, chose to do it for a logical reason, and didn't do it as smoothly as I will once I get my legs under me - yet I STILL met expectations. Because I'm good at what I do.

I didn't ""fumble"" because ""I'm an inherent failure."" I experienced a very normal situation and nobody batted an eye.

3687,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don‚Äôt know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I‚Äôm so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my ‚Äúthing‚Äù, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can‚Äôt you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your ‚Äúthing‚Äù?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I‚Äôm not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky.

3690,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I work in academia, and I'm well familiar with people who are struggling with impostor syndrome.

My personal impression is that the most common type around me is women who feel like they never work enough and then overwork themselves and become bitter and serious. It's a serious condition.

# My problem

**However**, lately I'm thinking if imposter syndrome is actually my problem.

My issue is, on the surface, *the opposite*. I find it hard to do any work at all. As soon as I face the smallest wall that I have to jump over (metaphorically speaking), I won't do any more work that day.

I find it hard doing even a half hour of work a day. Or finish anything else in my life.

Now, by working remotely, conversations with other co-workers are not so frequent and that makes me think everybody is working harder than I am. 

I also had this feeling that my supervisors are constantly looking at the chat to spot if I am online or not and whenever I did a break, I felt guilty and I tried to be back at work as soon as possible because my brain kept telling me ""Your boss probably has already called several times and you are here....having lunch.....pffff, you really do not deserve this job"". 

Well, once I started to ignore these thoughts and take my time to have lunch or to have a conversation with my family, I felt much better.

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment. As soon as I become inconvenient, annoying or difficult to deal with in any way, I feel certain they will withdraw that ""love"" immediately. This makes me a constant, obsessive perfectionist and brings me no end of anxiety. 
* I am worthless / have no worth as a person; I am inherently selfish and bad, and no matter how hard I work these things will always be true, there is nothing I can do to change them.

I can't express in words just how much it means to me that the peers I work with, by majority, found that I had done, helped, and taught well enough over the last few months, while we all worked from home, to deserve that award.

3746,"A quick note - I only discovered information about imposter syndrome within the past 24 hours and I feel like I have really discovered what has been happening to me most of my life. 

&nbsp;


Last year I was offered a Leadership/Management Internship position at Walt Disney World - something that I have worked towards since my high school grad in 2011! I was placed into housekeeping leadership though I had no prior experience in it (all my leadership experience was front desk or merchandise) so I felt like I was thrown into unfamiliar territory. 


&nbsp;


I was there for about 6 months (internship was for 1 year and a potential permanent position was available at the end of it), assisted in opening a new resort, and about 3 months in I began to have extreme anxiety attacks at work - I would lock myself in my office and cry and have trouble catching my breath. The role as a leader wasn‚Äôt difficult per se, the role itself was something that I could do on a day to day basis. I told my parents and my s/o that I was out-of-place, that I missed guest interaction (there was little to no daily guest interaction unless there was a guest to apologize to), and that I felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in.


&nbsp;


Whereas those were all the truth, I feel like I didn‚Äôt tell them the full truth. I am extremely terrified of failing and letting people down. I felt like in a position of leadership at this level, I had so much daily weight put on me and I was scared I would fail (even though I had only received praise from my peers and those above me). Eventually I was struggling to get out of bed for what was meant to be my ‚Äúdream job‚Äù, or at least the start of it. I began to question what I wanted to for so long. I left that position and took a general merchandiser position (non-leadership) within the parks and now I feel so unfulfilled but worried to try to step into a leadership position. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm looking for...advice or validation? I‚Äôm terrified of applying for another leadership position in fear that this will happen again..I have no idea.

3750,"I am new to this sub but I wanted to throw a suggestion out. One of the pieces of advice I received about managing imposter syndrome was to keep a running list of positive feedback, accomplishments (big or small), successes, and compliments to reflect on and help to combat feelings of incompetence and not belonging.  

I wonder if folks on here would find any value in having a weekly thread where everyone could just comment with their weekly successes, accomplishments, or positive feedback received. I was thinking there would be no expectation about what success (etc.) means. Someone could write that they remembered to water the plants this week or they got a B on a paper or someone complimented the way they drafted that email or they felt like they might look dumb but they mustered the courage to ask that question in class anyway. The central idea being that it might help us remind ourselves that we do have skill, we are competent, we do belong. It could be a way for us to support one another as well. 

One potential downside I could see is that if folks are listing their successes it might make someone feel more like an imposter if they don't feel like they have something to contribute. Or with the process of upvoting someone might feel bad because they only got 2 but someone else got 10. But my hope would be that we could all support each other in whatever successes people post whether it seem small or large. If folks are interested we could assess how it's going after a few weeks or so and make sure it's helpful, not harmful.

3752,"I‚Äôve had IS for quite some time and it‚Äôs ruined my ability to form relationships with people who just want to support me. I can‚Äôt take a compliment or accept their praise and they get frustrated, even verbally angry at me for not ‚Äúunderstanding my worth‚Äù. This has lead to tension between my mother and I because she always wanted to uplift me and I felt guilty, as she was wasting time and energy on me. I then feel guilty that I‚Äôm rejecting love and support when there are a lot of people who are not fortunate enough to have a mother so loving. It‚Äôs sends me in a spiral, further enforcing my belief that I don‚Äôt deserve anything good, I was just lucky enough to be given a mom like her.

She passed away 7 months ago. I never got to tell her how grateful I am to have her constant support while I was struggling, (with mental illness and sobriety). I miss her more than words can describe.

One thing I hate is people telling me that I‚Äôm doing surprisingly well dealing with her death, which I take as a back handed compliment. Shouldn‚Äôt I be grieving more dramatically because she was so important to me? Why am I happy sometimes even though she‚Äôs gone? Are people expecting me to relapse because of the tragedy? How can people say that they admire my bravery and strength to carry on, especially when I spend hours stuck in the past, trying to remember her?

I feel like I‚Äôm only ‚Äúdoing surprisingly well‚Äù because I have shoved everything down and I am not working hard enough in therapy to address my grief, I‚Äôm only repeating what I‚Äôve read in books or posts of what the stages of dealing with grief look and sound like. I lie about my feelings to everyone, even my therapist. My therapist praises me for not relapsing into self destructing habits, but I feel like I haven‚Äôt fallen back on those because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint my mom, even though she is no longer here. The idea that I‚Äôm ‚Äústrong‚Äù is scary to me. I feel like these compliments create so much doubt in my head, causing me to relapse because that is what is expected of me. 

Through all of this, I don‚Äôt have my mom‚Äôs unconditional support to fall back on when I feel my life is a sham, I don‚Äôt have that one person who loves me no matter who I think or pretend I am. It‚Äôs tricky navigating my thoughts and feelings alone and I feel like I‚Äôve been killing myself looking for reassurance from other sources, like my work or social media, so much so that I have neglected working on my relationships with my family, who is hurting too. I don‚Äôt want to let them down the same way I let my mom down so many times, nor do I want to have them worry about me, or spend time and energy trying to support me as I will never truly feel validated. They should just continue believing I am ‚Äúdoing surprisingly well‚Äù even though I know I am faking it.

3775,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr.

Essentially, I feel like I've just been pretending to be smart my entire way through university. Like all I've been doing is just copying information from sources.

Even my dissertation. I just feel like I took information from organic chemistry books and websites and that I don't actually deserve any credit because if I hadn't had resources I wouldn't have been able to have done it. It's like I believe that if I didn't just *know* something without having to research it first that I don't really know it at all, even if I made sure I understood everything before I wrote about it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it. I just feel like I'm not actually an intelligent individual and I'm just really good at pretending to be. I look at other people who're graduating from the same course as me and think they must know more than me or they must actually deserve it compared to what I've been doing.

Now I'm not at uni anymore and I'm applying for jobs, I'm terrified that I'm not capable of working in the industry I've been studying for the last 3 years. The longer I spend applying for jobs and not hearing anything back, the worse I feel, because there's obviously a reason why nobody's responding to my applications.

3782,"i feel like i'm constantly lying or being a fraud in everything i do. for example: 

1. i did get accepted into a *really* good college, which i committed to, but i feel like i shouldn't have because a) its easy to get in, hard to stay in, so ill probably drop out anyway. b) everyone is gonna be so much smarter and better than me. c) it costs so much to pay international tuition and even though my dad said its okay, i feel really bad for choosing the more expensive option d) my grade aren't even that great
2. i feel like i shouldn't have friends because i'm always thinking about what i don't like about a person to make me distance myself from them, i'm always the afterthought friend, i always feel like i have to put up a front for each and every person for them to like me and i'm just lying to everybody. I also constantly feel like every nice act that someone does to me is fake. it's like in my head if: someone compliments me = they're being fake nice out of manners, someone does something nice for me = they're pitying me. this is even down to things like homework.
3. ever since i was a kid, my parents constantly compared me as inferior to my older sisters, so every single decision in my life that i made has been to distinguish myself from them. my grades are better, i got into a better university, i'm more ""obedient"" to my parents, etc yet i still get ""why aren't you as smart/responsible/organised/blahblahblah as your sister?"". To family and friends, my sisters are the ""successful one"", the ""smart one"" and i'm always, ""the one that's good at looking pretty"". I want to be recognised as intelligent and ambitious too. The other day my sister got her hair cut in the same haircut that i've been planning for two years (she didn't know, so it isn't her fault) and i got so upset about being compared to her if i did cut my hair like that (we look really similar), that i impulse cut my hair a really different hairstyle.
4. i feel like everything i do isn't enough. when i got accepted to college, the first things my mother asked me were ""on what grounds?"" ""can they take it back"" and then ""where is (name of my friend she really likes) going? medicine? omg i'm so proud of her!"" and every time my college topic comes up, she only talks about my friend and how amazing she is. my mother hasn't talked to me about college once. today, while we were taking about a trip that i'll take alone to my hometown, i told her my sister and her boyfriend would pick me up from the airport, and she said to me, ""nobody cares enough to go that far for you.""

Although, I have grown to be OK with rich people, in high school, I deeply resented almost all of my classmates as I felt that it was unjust the circumstances I grew up in (living with family in one bed room apt, subletting,  being food insecure, and even cleaning offices/houses with my mom on weekends). It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter. I had nightmares very very often and would wake up at like 4 or 5 AM to edit group presentations just so i wouldn't let other people down. 

In college, it's a lot better since people can't come over and what not and are somewhat more mature. But, now that I am an upperclassman, I feel an immense pressure to go into IB/Finance. I received some Bulge Bracket firm interviews and even made it to final round, but didn't get the summer internship. I felt like I was a failure to my family and to myself and to the expectations of my colleagues in college. I don't know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel that IB/finance is meant for the rich and that they ovviously have an upper hand while I have to fight to get myself a position. Even stupid jocks get jobs just b/c of alumni connections. It's just discouraging ......

A little about me: I started a new job about 3 months ago. I love it! I feel like I'm being challenged and a part of something awesome. Love my boss and coworkers. The problem is that I have realized how little I actually know and how often it causes me to fuck up at work. I feel like every other day my manager is confronting me about yet another mistake. 

It kind of came to a head on Monday when I not only screwed up a 2 week project, but I mishandled a piece of Very Expensive machinery. My boss told me that people have been fired for a similar mistake and next time I WILL lose my job. 

I have an advanced degree but I feel like an absolute bonehead. I know we all make mistakes, but I honestly I don't know why I haven't been fired yet. I also have anxiety which doesn't help... but man it feels like I'm not cut out for this.

3793,"Hi everyone!

I've  been on a journey to improve my mental well-being and develop healthier thought patterns. Over the past year, I've faced challenges with  anxiety and found it difficult to break out of negative thought cycles. A. I  tried mindfulness exercises, but however hard I tried, I couldn't shut  off my thoughts. That's why I started looking for a different approach. That's when I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I started  challenging my unrealistic thoughts and learned how to react to them in a  more reasonable way.

However, doing this on your own, instead of with a therapist, is difficult. Even if you have a therapist, you only get help once a week instead of every time you are struggling with negative thoughts. So, I took matters  into my own hands and developed an app to make the process more  accessible and user-friendly. Here's how the app works:

1. Write a note whenever you find yourself overwhelmed by unhelpful thoughts.
2. The app analyzes your note, identifying common cognitive distortions.
3. Receive personalized suggestions to challenge and reframe your thoughts.

I've already got a couple hundred users and great feedback but I feel like imposter syndrome is basically the definition of distorted thinking, so I thought this might help a lot of you fighting imposter syndrome, and help me tailor the apps to your needs. The app is available as a beta on iOS and Android. 

If you're interested in trying it out and sharing your thoughts, please leave a comment or send me a direct message or join the Discord community where you can find all links you need: [https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3](https://discord.gg/KknXwD5Bq3)

We had a regional visit not to long ago too where his boss was very impressed by me and he said I was a Rockstar.

Fast forward to yesterday.  He visited my store and said one of the areas I'm over was not set up correctly and that we're not on proper process there and thar I need to move a lot of it around and work to get on process.  He was cordial, but I still felt a bit crushed by it and haven't been able to get it off my mind.  I've started taking steps to set things right, but I already feel like I'll fail on the follow up and the confidence and good reputation I have built will be destroyed.  I keep saying I want to step down from my position, but I can't afford that.

It sucks because every time I start to feel like I'm gaining control of this stuff, something sets me back.  It does stem from the fact that I failed in a similar position in the past, so I'm fearful of further failure, as I've felt like I've been on a redemption arc since then.

3798,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day.

3823,"TL;DR: I landed an internship at the highest ranked law firm in my country bc I‚Äôm skilled at taking exams, not because I‚Äôm super smart. Also, my writing skills aren‚Äôt great. I feel like such an impostor and like I‚Äôm going to fail before everyone‚Äôs eyes/get a bad internship-report/grade after my internship ends. Any advice? - Not necessarily looking for life changing solutions (although welcome!), but any advice/tips/words of encouragement or other opinions are appreciated :) 

*edit: the ‚Äòhighest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it‚Äôs one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt belong there

‚Äî-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I‚Äôve been more insecure than ever lately & I‚Äôm having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‚Äòranked‚Äô #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don‚Äôt always say everything - but let‚Äôs just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it‚Äôs because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‚Äòhonors/cum laude‚Äô grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I‚Äôm not trying to say I‚Äôm absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I‚Äôm not actually super talented, I‚Äôm just good at ‚Äòtaking exams‚Äô + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I‚Äôm neurodivergent and am quite ‚Äòslow‚Äô in understanding things (even if it‚Äôs something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren‚Äôt so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‚Äògrade‚Äô I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I‚Äôm a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

3824,"Hi Reddit.   
I want to caveat this post by saying I know how lucky I am and that I have realised suffering is relative and money does not mean happiness. Not by a long shot. 

On paper life is great. Earlier this year I came up with an idea with some friends and we build this company which we promptly sold (finalising last week). At the same time, ive met a woman of my dreams. Loving, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.   


Last week, I got paid for selling the company. I now have more money than I know what to do with and the love of a beautiful woman. Everything should be great right?   


When I got paid out last Friday I started having panic attacks and questioning my happiness. Not so much if I deserve it but coming to terms that, somehow, for reasons I cant really put my finger on I am not happy. I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in my life at a fairly early age but it has caused me to realise that I didnt even know what I truly wanted.   


I started withdrawing into myself in regards to my relationship almost immediately. Questioning my feelings and thoughts for this person who is changing my life for the better on a daily basis.   


I asked her for some space to try and figure this out and it backfired. Badly. To the point where she is saying I need to figure things out before I can ""have others in my life"".   


I now dont know what to make of it all. I am coming to terms with my new life but after working so hard for so long and going nowhere and being alone for so long only to have achieved all this ""success"" in both my personal and professional life so quickly has left me confused, anxious and extremely emotional.   


I think perhaps I dont feel worthy of it all.

But.........I feel like a rookie. There are some many new processes and systems to understand and these things take time which isn't always easy to find when you are doing daily fire fighting dealing with sickness, safeguardings, shift cover, being a smiling friendly face of the home with a need to promote it as a business etc etc. Yesterday I was filled with anxiety, today has been better but the lurking fear is there that I will be found out as not able to do the job

I also need to watch what I'm saying to people as my usual line at the minute is, well I'm new and still learning so I don't know all the answers etc etc but I'll try my best

There's so much to learn and I'm committed to that and determined, I can usually harness the anxiety as that's just normal part of growth and new situations but I'm off the back of a bad work experience about a year ago when I got bullied out of somewhere when people played on weaknesses and I didn't think I was supported well or had a good induction

3829,"I‚Äôm kinda realizing a glaring issue I have that tremendously hinders my time management and my school/life balance in general  

I‚Äôm a graphic design major. The first step in every project (or, like, project extension) is research. We research subject matter, connecting themes and concepts, color pallets, design styles, font choices and parings, design techniques etc. It‚Äôs an important part of our process, and then comes sketches and executing our chosen concept. (This all will be relevant in a min)

I‚Äôm in a super competitive design program. Two portfolio review processes not before, but after semesters of design classes. Only 40 of the 400 end up making it. 
It was hell, but it‚Äôs my senior year and I‚Äôm almost finished. I used to really like graphic design, I was passionate about it. I worked my ass off to make it through the portfolio reviews.  I think I placed my whole identity and self worth in my ‚Äòdream career‚Äô. I had so many anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns during the portfolio review portion of this degree (the first 2 years). Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about passing the review, but I think i was mentally in fight or flight mode for so long that my brain is still recovering and something isn‚Äôt quite right. 

Despite making it through both reviews, My confidence is shattered. I second guess every decision I make. Everyone around me is so talented and I feel like a fraud. I‚Äôve worked really hard to get here, but I‚Äôm so burnt out I can barley function. I have pretty strong negative associations with school, class, my work, and myself. 


Every single night, we have assignments and things we need to present in the next class. And every single night, the same cycle repeats.

I research, research, research. I spend hours stuck gathering inspiration, jotting down concepts, all because I‚Äôm afraid of moving onto the next step. I don‚Äôt eat meals, I don‚Äôt spend time with friends, and I‚Äôm not even doing any of the ‚Äòreal‚Äô work until my internal clock kicks in maybe around 3 AM or in the morning before class. It‚Äôs always rushed together and I‚Äôm never proud of it. Because I‚Äôm never proud of my work, doing homework the next day becomes even harder. My brain does NOT want to move past the research step. Ever. I never feel ready. I loop myself into a constant cycle of spending WAY to much time on a meaningless first step, neglecting the important work, and feeling shitty about myself. I‚Äôll be on my laptop after hours of throwing together pages and pages of mood boards I will hardly use, still doing the same thing and mentally screaming at myself to stop and I can‚Äôt. I never do, until the very last minute where I‚Äôll have no other choice to.
I am self aware that this isn‚Äôt helping me, and yet every time in the moment I‚Äôll still subconsciously justify it by convincing myself ‚Äòat least I‚Äôm being productive rn, I‚Äôll move on to the next step soon."" (It‚Äôs never soon) Im so upset at myself because I know if I could actually manage my time I‚Äôd have have the time to get everything done that I need to and still enjoy things like spending time with people, making meals, getting enough sleep, etc. I have the time to make quality work, too. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt let myself do any of that. 

I‚Äôve pulled 5 all-nighters in the first 4 weeks. I‚Äôve already missed 3 classes and been 30 min late to 2. Again, I don‚Äôt hang out with friends, I hardly ever eat full meals, i don‚Äôt go to parties or bars or play video games or any of that. It feels like this is all I do and my work is never good and I‚Äôm just making myself miserable. I‚Äôm so upset at myself and I deeply regret the hours and hours I waste on a daily basis.

My entire college experience has been like this, except at some point I was actually motivated by a love for graphic design. At this point I just want it to be over. I‚Äôm so tired, I feel defeated. There‚Äôs no way this is even a viable career option for me if I can‚Äôt even balance my projects in college. 


Sorry if this seemed really dramatic, I didn‚Äôt sleep last night.

3830,"For some context, I was super driven after graduating college(around 7 years ago) to land something at one of the FAANGs, I mean who isn't right? After a point I‚Äôd just do it for laughs, but last time I did(not a FAANG but pretty up there! about 4 months ago), I landed an interview. My reaction? I was laughing, OUT LOUD and kinda ready to fall flat on my face during this process (Thought it would be one hell of an experience). It was supposed to be a very thorough process with 5, FIVE different rounds! as I was told. Well I did the first one ready to be rejected right away(even though I was prepping hard). To my surprise, I received an email with the schedule for the next one a couple days later while I was still working. if you‚Äôre curious about what my response was - I took sometime to read the email over and over again just to make sure this was not just a hallucination, walked straight from my home office to my bedroom and did my happy dance LOL

In summary, I wasn‚Äôt hoping to get in at all since I didn‚Äôt apply with the intention/drive to making it. Given that they absolutely destroyed me in the last one, I was now ready for a very generic rejection email. But hear me out - I GOT IN PEOPLE!

3831,"It occurred to me earlier today that this is an opportunity to prove to myself that I‚Äôm not an imposter and I can and should be doing this job, but the truth is I don‚Äôt believe that and I can‚Äôt stop freaking out about it. 

I always get nervous about presentations and talks but this is a whole other level. I‚Äôve been feeling sick and dizzy since I agreed to it (why oh why did I agree to it - oh yeah, because if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd feel like an even bigger imposter), I‚Äôve had a tension headache for a few days now, last night I woke up the pain was so bad, and it‚Äôs like my whole body is just really tense all the time and I have this constant sense of dread that I cannot shake.

Maybe I have anxiety. If I don‚Äôt feel better after the presentation I‚Äôll go to the GP.

I think what‚Äôs making it worse is it‚Äôs with my boss (or in front of him) and I already feel like he made a mistake hiring me and I‚Äôm not the person he thought I was. I wasn‚Äôt going to apply because I thought it was too much of a step up for me, but my recruiter talked me into it, and by some miracle I did well in the interview. Normally I‚Äôm bad at interviews but know I can do the job. This time it was like I became one of those people who interviews well but doesn‚Äôt really have what it takes to deliver.

It‚Äôs also probably the most objectively important presentation I‚Äôve ever had to do.

I‚Äôve never messed up a presentation before, in fact people have even complimented me on them in the past (I think they‚Äôre pleasantly surprised because I make no secret of how much I hate doing them - to colleagues, not the people I‚Äôm presenting to), but I can‚Äôt help thinking this is the one I‚Äôm going to mess up. It doesn‚Äôt help that my many practice runs still aren‚Äôt great and don‚Äôt seem to be getting better. It especially doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm going to be presenting on Teams, which I‚Äôve never done before, and our whole IT system is changing tomorrow. 

The sad thing is, even if I have another miracle and it goes well tomorrow, I know that won‚Äôt be enough for me to believe I‚Äôm not an imposter and I can and should do this job. I‚Äôll just pass it off as a fluke or dismiss it as inconsequential. There‚Äôs always another way I could fail - another way I have to prove myself.

3834,"Alrighty, little background about me. M20, currently going to uni for Health Studies and I‚Äôm in my third year. This year, most of my classes have in personal components, but the last two were all virtually online. Now my issue here is that, I hardly ever try for my classes and I pump out 90 after 90 and keep getting told that I‚Äôm doing so well and get told that they can see that I put effort into my writing. When in actuality, I put a total of 5 hours of effort, the day before it‚Äôs due. Getting this kind of feedback day in and out and then seeing people who ACTUALLY put in the effort getting 60‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs is crushing my mind with guilt and anxiety. I don‚Äôt even tel anyone my average because I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve it, even saying that I get 90‚Äôs while doing literally doing all the work last minute makes me sick to my stomach. 

For example, on a essay I had to write about a social topic of concern, I choose food scarcity. So did 5 other people. Now, I obviously left it to the last minute, threw some things together and BAM, essay done. Everyone else, took the entire 2 months allotted to this assignment that‚Äôs worth 40% of our overall grade to do it. Grades come back and I was fully expecting a 60% and I would‚Äôve been okay with that. Turns out I got a 97% and everyone else, got a 68% or lower. And when everyone asked me how long did I work on it, I felt so guilty telling them that I worked on it for 8 hours before the deadline and got a 30% higher grade when they spent over a month researching and writing and editing. I‚Äôm by no means the smartest person in the room, and I definitely don‚Äôt feel like I deserve the grades that I‚Äôm somehow pulling out of thin air, but I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty over this.

3835,"Hi, I'm on mobile so formatting may be an issue.

I feel stupid even though I'm predicted mostly As and A*s. Just typing that statement makes me feel stupid, as I think that my good grades should prove to me that im not stupid, so I shouldn't be suffering from imposter syndrome.
Also, I study by doing past papers, so I have to mark them myself. However, there are two problems with this. I usually have to stop marking half way through the paper because I'm too scared of what the end score will be that I feel like I can't keep marking to find out. I know that I might get a good score but I'm too scared of getting a bad score so I can't keep marking it.
Another problem is that if an answer is incorrect, sometimes I have to mark it correct just to keep a good score, even though getting that question wrong doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to get a bad score overall. This makes me feel bad because I'm lying, yet I can't seem to stop doing these things.

I'm not sure if that last part fits with imposter syndrome, but it seemed to link with it, sorry if this isn't the case.

My entire life I would wait until someone became a really close friend and I would confess to them that I'm racked with these irrational fears of everyone finding out that I'm a fraud and completely unqualified to be who i am and because of these fears I tend to live my life in a cycle of creating perfection in my career, family, home, wardrobe, parenting, etc and then reaching some undefined peak, only to watch myself burn it all the ground.

3842,"I battled a brain tumor called a vestibular schwannoma all of last year. It hurt. I was in so much pain, feeling so dizzy like a mix of a bad hangover and the stomach virus. I'd feel intensely weak, confused, and haunted by a vicious ringing in my ear. It was like hearing a bagpipe or teakettle going off in my ears 24/7, while the other symptoms happened EVERYDAY for hours on end, to barying degrees. The vertigo was also terrible. Sometimes I'd fall over. Sometimes I'd have a panic attack while going through it. Sometimes it'd last for hours. It would even keep me from sleeping. Then there are the dangerous situations I was put in because of the loss of balance and loss of hearing 

Due to the COVID pandemic, it was t easy to seek professional medical care. Doctors would make me wait months or even into the next year which I outright refused. I took my own data on my symptoms, my medication, my food, ans the time of day these symptoms happened, all to give insight and remove any extraneous variables as to what was happening. The ER doctors couldnt help me as they didn't find a brain tumor on the CT scan. It wasn't until I got an MRI two months later while going through all of this, that the WNT diagnosed the brain tumor. Not to mention the severe hearing loss in both ears, especially the left.

I saw the best in others and I saw the worst. My mental health suffered while waiting for care. And worst of all the doctors were somewhat dismissive of my needs. It wasn't until I saw a doctor at Duke University Medical Center, one of the most advanced medical centers in the world for skull base tumors, even able to perform operations no other medical center can, that I got real help.

A Vestibular Achwannoma has a high survival rate. Mine wasn't that big at 7mm ans some survive even larger. 

I talk a lot about it on my GoFundMe my friends made, where I post updates and on social media as well.

And yet, a part of me feels like maybe it wasn't that bad. I didn't die. I didn't end up like the others who are worse off than I am today. I felt I was dying and was even suicidal, thinking and plotting ways to off myself that would be considered an accident. I didn't want to live life with the amount of hearing loss I had, the potential for permanent dizziness, ans these tormenting symptoms to continue even after surgery (which the symptoms have since resolved sans the hearing loss).

Maybe I'm a whiner. Maybe I'm not simply updating friends and gsmiyl, but looking for attention. Maybe I shouldn't have spent my GoFundMe donations on more than just medical bills - like a dietician, additional physical therapy, and yoga lessons. All were to help me adjust to life after a brain tumor and improve my almost non-existent balance. But it wasn't specifically necessary, even if it worked.

I know what I went through was real, and nobody else's opinion on the matter has any meaning but mine. Even now, I still talk to a therapist who I've seem throughout this process. She says this is normal for many, these feelings. What I went through was real. Did someone doubt me? Yep, but nobody else sided with those people.

3848,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I‚Äôm in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

‚ÄúYou went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won‚Äôt make enough because of it to make that ok‚Äù

‚ÄúYour almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??‚Äù

It‚Äôs the answer to the last one that makes me realize I‚Äôve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I‚Äôve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I‚Äôm a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn‚Äôt know I just couldn‚Äôt hack it academically, even though I‚Äôve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn‚Äôt worked, it‚Äôs because those around me wouldn‚Äôt let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fianc√© before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù and snap everyone around me out of it.

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‚ÄòBecause I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others‚Äô or ‚ÄòI choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other‚Äôs accomplishments‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards‚Äô. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as ‚Äì by its very nature ‚Äì it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‚Äòus‚Äô and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",think ‚Äô belong think ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô fraud getting idea station ‚Äô worthy really Sound familiar Welcome Imposter Syndrome ‚Äô good company Nigella Lawson Michelle Obama Lady GaGa Lily Allen shared imposter syndrome experience publicly demon ‚Äô umbrella term life one limiting belief generalised one may accompanied specific belief typically formed rationally childhood child may serve u well example ¬∑ need everyone approve ¬∑ valued must succeed everything ¬∑ OK make mistake bad ¬∑ feel happy life without contributing back way ¬∑ Everyone need rely someone stronger ¬∑ ‚Äô feel sadness discomfort pain ¬∑ Someone somewhere take responsibility would list look like However time move thing change become adult childhood belief serve u le well ‚Äì resultant behaviour may incongruent situation lead conclusion one thing mean grow develop childhood belief adopt new set belief serve u better adult progression follows broad pattern developing dependence child independence young adult interdependence mature adult overall set belief developing time However u carry childhood belief u adulthood innocuous time sometimes impede performance high functioning interdependent adult adult benefit identifying limiting belief growing valuable belief way example common limiting belief sitting Imposter Syndrome umbrella ‚Äò must compare others ‚Äô reframed ‚Äò live life term ‚Äô ‚Äò unique set character strength others ‚Äô turn reframed belief underpin valuable affirmation ‚Äò live life enjoy success others ‚Äô ‚Äò choose celebrate success without reference ‚Äô accomplishment ‚Äô ‚Äò fact choose live life authentically mean compare standard ‚Äô standard element working PERMA hypnotherapy developing high degree selfawareness via exploring character strength value belief limiting belief pave way defining identity turn leaf ideally placed choose best future Working hypnotherapist particularly well suited personal development area ‚Äì nature ‚Äì open pathway part know recognise ‚Äò u ‚Äô deeper level wisdom ideal need take big step forward,trust

3855,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university.

3875,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them.

3883,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me ‚Äúthere were people who did not want to employ you‚Äù and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either ‚ÄúI think you are an idiot‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are now fired‚Äù. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...‚Äù. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn‚Äôt 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It‚Äôs silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don‚Äôt remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager‚Äôs manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I‚Äôve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it‚Äôs ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",Hi 2 year ago got job Fortune 500 company previously worked small scale startup huge jump excited start felt confident made first day Aaaaand started meeting people team would go something like hey name Adamfiction software engineer master x PhD worked IBM awarded insert achievement Aaaaand realised huge change culture culture shock every day daunting started feeling small used shame think accomplishment good enough would thing everyone work age somehow made much worse would talk meeting someone ask opinion would agree someone instead saying anything scared sound stupid One day line manager told ‚Äú people want employ ‚Äù comment needed reinforce belief around incompetence started actively avoiding colleague thought conversation would go either ‚Äú think idiot ‚Äù ‚Äú fired ‚Äù Saying seems insane time real one colleague invited talk corner booth started shaking convinced day fired lose everything laugh one team meeting said something along line ‚Äú new recent graduate might good idea ‚Äù head team pulled aside noticed imposter syndrome noticed avoiding people avoiding expressing saying thing way sound guarded introduced peer felt started changed life Finally someone relate first meeting started talking struggle cried 30 min telling feel worthless like supposed like hired mistake quota suggested get therapist something well took year month overcome come back every However try remember thing help feel better 1 reason selected among 100 people 2 work good important bit weird keep log thank emailsmessages get good outcome feel everything stupid read remember ‚Äô 3 Remember people different path ‚Äô silly since assume everyone age seems always accomplished remember start career try imagine people start career 4 People often ‚Äô remember conversation even think said something stupid chance walk away forget dwell week write script head prepare future conversation person 5 Rank important think someone line manager ‚Äô manager celebrity scared talk 6 Everybody start somewhere started tracking learned look back see far ‚Äô come 7 Might cultural thing ‚Äô ok acknowledge achievement mean bragging 8 engineer way people see 9 Asking question talking people sigh weakness 10 Sharing experience one easiest way build relationship,trust

3886,"I began working at a software company only a month or so after I graduated with my bachelor's, about 3 years ago.

The company, the owner, the department heads, and nearly everybody else is happy, super polite and nice, upbeat every day, Type-A, and really fucking smart. I didn't think I had any business, much less skill and social skills at all, to be working with so many people like that.

I was anxious, depressed, nearly throwing up every morning before work for months and months, and thinking I might be fired at any moment once they discovered that I was a fraud and not as smart as they thought I was at my interview.

I felt like such a fish out of water for the first year, at least, before I started to even get a little bit comfortable. Even then I only felt like I was barely holding my head above water with the knowledge that I gained of the software I had to support on a daily basis.

Every quarter, we have a full company meeting, this last one being held virtually today due to the shit going on right now. Before each quarterly meeting, everybody in my department submits a nominee from within our group to be employee of the quarter.

This morning, at our virtual meeting, it was announced that I had been chosen as Employee of the Quarter from my service department. I can't express in words just how much it means to me that the peers I work with, by majority, found that I had done, helped, and taught well enough over the last few months, while we all worked from home, to deserve that award.

3899,"I know I have the imposter syndrome. I also know I am not doing my best to stay as sharp in my field as I could be (so many unread articles, ugh)...(I say as I have a full-day training I‚Äôm psyched to attend in 6 hours) [sarcasm/not sarcasm...I‚Äôm looking forward to the training but I‚Äôm  up waaaay too late]

My job can be VERY stressful and risky and needs lots of split-second judgments sometimes. I made one, I can back it up, but it caused conflict and I was prob not 100% in the right in how I did it...which leads me to start doubting myself completely. And there was another tense convo where I had to advocate for myself when I was getting some pushback earlier this week...which is tough for me to do as a person, but it made me second guess myself as a professional. But again, I thiiink I‚Äôm doing the best I can there, and if it‚Äôs an issue, it‚Äôs more about my approach vs efficacy (like getting a deep tissue massage vs reiki).

Last night I met my SO's parents. They're well-to-do: Wealthy, accomplished, connected - the whole bit.   
They were completely warm and welcoming and the evening was fine.

I am smart and have a career trajectory that I know people find impressive. In theory, I belong. But even so, I felt so much less than them. Honestly, afterward, I wanted to curl up into a ball. 

It's hard to divorce the person you are today from where or how you grew up. 

No amount of wealth or success seems to alter that internal, mental image of yourself as that kid from that not-so-great family.

It comes in waves, all things I do not know. Sometimes it's the small things (a butter keeper - what's that?) and sometimes it's the larger things, all the social norms of the classes above me that I'm still learning. 

I worry I stick out like a sore thumb. I worry I'm not worth the same as these other people. But then what is the worth of a human life?

3909,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

Now I wonder if there is such a thing as impostor by proxy?

Or if both are in the same field and in the same office (say, both are programmers and work on the same project, they check each other's codes occasionally). One is honest and gives good review, the other degrades the other persons coding skills (even if they are obviously on the same level) and eventually the downgraded person will start believing that they're really not good enough.

I wonder if this is impostor by proxy or something else like gaslighting? Maybe it's gas lighting but the result, impostor syndrome, is the same. But it fo.es by a proxy bot by themselves even if it then continues to com from themselves... is this even coherent? Do I make sense?

4. i feel like everything i do isn't enough. when i got accepted to college, the first things my mother asked me were ""on what grounds?"" ""can they take it back"" and then ""where is (name of my friend she really likes) going? medicine? omg i'm so proud of her!"" and every time my college topic comes up, she only talks about my friend and how amazing she is. my mother hasn't talked to me about college once. today, while we were taking about a trip that i'll take alone to my hometown, i told her my sister and her boyfriend would pick me up from the airport, and she said to me, ""nobody cares enough to go that far for you.""
5. i've developed social anxiety, panic attacks, and dermatillomania (skin picking, form of OCD)

Hi all,

I (27F) have always had ups and downs with anxiety, confidence and insecurity. I'm going through a rather difficult patch at the moment. I'm a journalist and I've just started a new job. I used to work on long form documentaries but making the switch back to daily news is really daunting.

I went through a very competitive interview process to get here, and I've always received very positive feedback on my work in every other job. So logically, I should feel like getting this job is really well-deserved.

However, the other members of the team are extremely good - intimidatingly so. There are many people here with a lot more experience than me (even the more junior members of the team) who seem to be far fuller of ideas than I am and much more vocal. They approach their work with a confidence and conviction that I can never see myself having.

I am much shyer than my coworkers and struggle to speak up in meetings. I have been trying to force myself to do this more, and even recently spoke at a public event to try and gain more confidence. It hasn't got any easier at all, and I still cringe when I hear myself speaking in front of a large group. I don't feel like my ideas are as original, creative, fully formed and well-thought out as the ones many others pitch. I spend hours researching topics I'm interested in, but I struggle to form proper stories out of my ideas and therefore don't pitch very often. I know I should arrange a meeting with my boss to talk about these issues, but I feel like they are always so busy and I don't want them to think they've made a mistake by hiring me if I highlight my insecurities.

Because I'm so intimidated by my coworkers, I feel reluctant to start conversations or even make small talk with them, even though I know I would benefit from doing this and learn a lot from them. I know it actually looks worse that I'm not taking the time to engage with them, but the thought of doing so makes me anxious.

I just feel like a great big fraud, really. I want to become a really good journalist, but I know this anxiety and lack of self-esteem is really holding me back.

Does anyone else here have similar experiences at work? Any tips that might help?

TL;DR: I'm struggling with imposter syndrome at work and it's affecting my ability to do my job and form relationships with my team.

3932,"Soo I have a long list of illnesses/disabilities and I always feel like I'm lying about them.
Ever since I was little, I was taught that I was not as sick as I felt and just talking myself into it/faking it. The reasoning behind this was that I should learn to go to school no matter what because when you are a working adult you can't always be sick either. I also had a friend who was anxious about getting sick and dying because of every little discomfort (hypochondriac) and it made me scared that I could have the same disorder instead of being actually sick.

One moment I feel like this thinking has had a major impact on my physical health because I didnt take symptoms seriously, then I feel like an imposter who only feels sorry for themselves. Every time I have any symptoms I feel like a pussy and I had to learn the hard way that I have to take breaks for my immune system, I now have severe asthma with biweekly attacks. Btw even while having the attacks I feel like an imposter.

3948,"I‚Äôve always had issues with imposter syndrome but it‚Äôs never been this bad and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I am in my last 3 months of graduate school where I am set to complete a dual masters degree with a dual concentration.

I‚Äôm currently completing my Capstone for my degree and I‚Äôm struggling horribly with writing just the proposal. I have no idea how to write a sound study design and can‚Äôt wrap my head around writing all most 10 pages worth of information on a project that is still far into the future (in terms of data sources, limitations I might have, data analysis). 

When I was in the thick of my graduate curriculum I always received good grades and got things done on time, but I think I just learned how to do homework really well. For example, I was taking my degree at an accelerated rate in order to graduate sooner, so I was completing more classes than was recommended or than what my peers were. Because of this, a lot of the assigned reading/work for each class was doubled so I physically wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete all of it exactly as I should‚Äôve, in a timely manner, while also trying to live a life and working full time. My work around was that I would skim a lot of it, and never do any of the optional or supplemental work. I would give the bare minimum of effort on assignments, in order to get an A or high B. And it worked, like I said I completed my curriculum with a high 3.8 GPA. But now‚Ä¶ I think I really regret not reading everything word for word. I feel like I can‚Äôt even tell you what I learned.

Not to mention, from reading the basic job descriptions I have almost no qualifications‚Ä¶so like why did I even put myself in this much debt for these degrees that apparently mean nothing now?

3952,"Alright, before I start. No, this isn't a confirmation to see if have imposter syndrome post. This is just me kind of asking and speaking about this strange dilemma I have from time to time.

I shared this info elsewhere but basically, I constantly downplay my own skills and capabilities. Always reminding myself that there is someone out there who basically surpasses me in everything I can/will do. (And yes, it does bring me down due to the accuracy of that statement.) That's not the main reason for this post.

Unlike most cases where it's usually job/hobby related. Mine is related to personality. I don't know why, I'm pretty sure I do not possess any kind of personality disorder. And I have been told repeatedly time after time again that I am a good person, but for some odd reason, my brain doesn't believe this and attempts to coerce me into believing that I am in an A-hole. Brewing the idea that I may as well expose myself as the a-hole In r/amitheasshole or r/Niceguys respectively.

No I have not done anything (to my knowledge), note worthy for a post there and yes, it's something that I constantly worry about. I'm worried that I'm secretly a disgusting incel, which is why I don't approach woman for any kind of flirting/relationship. Let alone converses with them.

I'm worried that I'm gonna upset an employee at retail because I need help with something even though that poor soul probably had to deal with borderline psychotic customers on a daily basis, if Reddit is to go by. So, I never ask.

3954,"I know I shouldn't be self diagnosing but I've been dealing with this for awhile and want to know if I need to be proactive. I've determined I have a LOT of the symptoms of Imposter Syndrome but I also have symptoms I'm not certain relate to it.

I usually feel like my passions would be accomplished better by someone else. I'm a writer and think I have great ideas but lack  talent, I feel like a hack.
I'm constantly envious of those around me and find myself being needlessly hateful to other people because I'm not as good as theme.
I'm terrified people will find out the truth about me. They'll discover I'm actually incredibly immature, that I'm mentally ill, that I'm scared, that I'm stupid.
Whenever I'm happy I feel like I'm fake.
I frequently experience this strange feeling of near dissacocistion where i realize I'm nobody. I'm nothing. Everyone else has a life, and they're usually happier than me, and that I'll never be what they perceive me to be. I feel like im just a shitty side character that would be better left forgotten.
I dropped out of high school because it was too stressful doing my job and school and living up to my mom's expectations. 
I want the world to know me and admire me but I don't want to be seen or heard. I'm scared of being forgotten, but just as scared of being remembered.

I should mention I have depression, autism,  ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar. I just want to get rid of this feeling of being a faker and a liar and to stop being so envious.

3957,"I'm not gonna get into it because I could write a book about it but I've got a lot of mental illness and even being diagnosed with them it's taken me a long time to grasp that I am very different from the people around me. It's been starting to hit me lately, my mom said I'm the weirdest person in the family and I often hear that I'm one of a kind but I take those statements as compliments because I appreciate being my own person but I think the awareness is making it harder to feel normal as myself.

I'm always trying to remind my coworkers to be mindful when they say mean things and I feel like a hypocrite when I do because who am I to correct them even though I make a conscious effort to be mindful. They've told me I can't change the world on my own but they also told me that I don't talk trash which is encouraging. When I'm with my friends I feel like I'm with people who share the same spirituality but I feel like a fraud. I feel like I don't belong no matter where I go. 

When I'm with my boyfriend and I tell him that I love him sometimes it's hard to look him in the eye because I feel like he won't believe me. I can't keep my hands off of him which worries me more that he'll think it's lust when I just love him a lot and I feel a transfer of that energy when I touch him. 

It is the most confusing thing to be so sure about my connection with someone and the solidity of the relationship but to also second guess it knowing that there is no reason to. Having had a toxic relationship in the past where my tunnel vision was so strong that I glorified every flaw and let him warp my being, it's difficult not to worry I'm doing the same thing sometimes but I know I'm not but back then I would've thought the same so how can I ever know.

After a point I‚Äôd just do it for laughs, but last time I did(not a FAANG but pretty up there! about 4 months ago), I landed an interview. My reaction? I was laughing, OUT LOUD and kinda ready to fall flat on my face during this process (Thought it would be one hell of an experience). It was supposed to be a very thorough process with 5, FIVE different rounds! as I was told. Well I did the first one ready to be rejected right away(even though I was prepping hard).

I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends. I just feel ashamed when people with so many accolades Call ME smart or talented.

3968,"Not sure if this fits in this subreddit, but here we go lol. Short version: I am lazy by nature. However, in February I decided to start working 2 jobs and pay down a bunch of my student loan debt. I also got a job I really enjoy and may have finally found my career path. Because I'm currently so active, every new person I meet thinks I'm some sort of go-getter. 

Long version: I consider myself quite a lazy person because outside of work and exercising a bit, I mainly spend my time playing video games. I'm very introverted, so I don't go out much and meet new people very often, but I have been on a couple of online dating apps, which is where this fa√ßade started. I bring up working 2 jobs and I even take a course my current company is paying for, and everyone is really impressed not even on just the apps, but at work too. 

Without going too much into detail, I graduated university about 6 years ago, and for 5 years, I was in a very deep cycle of depression. I moved in with my mother after a big lay off and I was only paying on the interest of a few private student loans, not even making a dent in the principle balance. Late last year though, I decided enough would be enough, and earlier this year I started working a 2nd job and am able to use the money for my student loans. I got a new main job in January and the company is paying for a course for me to take to advance my career, so I'm also taking that. So yes, it seems like I'm active, and in fact I am no longer depressed at all, but I'm only active now to make up for the last 5 years of being a lazy bastard. And honestly, I'm probably going to go back to being lazy once all of my debt is done with and my course is over.

3973,"Okay so,  the title says it all basically.  I have struggled with IS for years, and generally end up internalizing it.  Mostly due to syndrome making me believe that I am just a whiny baby, not someone with an actual problem worth taking up time, money, and resources to fix.  

This internalizing has lead to countless occasions of hurting the people closest to me because of viewing the world from my skewed perspective as well as sabotaging myself and having to start over in life constantly.

3975,"This is my first post here. I'm sorry if I break any rules.

I'm struggling to formulate the results. No matter what I write, I feel like all the results are bullshit or too simple or unnecessary or not scientific or all of the above. My procrastination does not help this issue either.

I am convinced, my thesis is just bad and I'm ashamed to present the results to anyone. Even though I know that I suffer from imposter syndrome, (I'm in therapy for this and other reasons), I TRUELY believe that what I'm doing is bad and that I am stupid. People saying otherwise just do it to be nice or to cheer me up.

I am constantly wondering how I made it this far without being called out as a fraud.  How did I make it through? How am I holding jobs? How is no one thinking I'm stupid? I'm so scared of sharing any of my knowledge with the constant fear of being judged and discovered as a fraud.

I'm dreading the moment I have to hand in my thesis. I'm dreading the moment I will get my final grade. I'm dreading the presentation where I have to defend my results.

I don't know what I'm getting from this. I just thought people here might relate. Maybe someone else reads it and will know that they're not alone. I certainly feel alone with this feeling right now. I feel like no one can help me but me. And I am not able to help myself.

Update: I handed it in last week!! The only thought that kept me going was ""It doesn't matter if it's bad. Just finish it somehow."" I couldn't convince myself that what I doing was good. But telling myself that it didn't matter and not to care worked to some extend. All that matters is to hand it in. Even if you think it's bad.

3981,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don‚Äôt know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I‚Äôm so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my ‚Äúthing‚Äù, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can‚Äôt you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your ‚Äúthing‚Äù?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I‚Äôm not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I‚Äôm saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can‚Äôt I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I‚Äôm a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking.

3982,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.

I'm also having trouble staying 'in-touch' with what's going on at university.

3986,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm so glad to find this sub. I‚Äôm a new graduate, I just graduated in October. My last semester was extremely light only 2 courses so I began looking and applying for full time jobs in the summer itself. I found a remote part time job on contract that I have until this april and took it so I‚Äôd have something to do while I look for full time. My father passed away in September and I didn‚Äôt actively look for a while before or after.

Now, after a couple months of very consistent applying for probably hundreds of jobs and 3 interviews- I got a full time permanent job offer at a GREAT company, in my field too. Excellent entry level opportunity. My mom is over the moon and so are family and friends BUT.. 

The position is set to start in July and every single day I feel like I will lose it before even starting it. That I will receive an email one random day and they just take it back for no reason. My mom wanted to celebrate with friends and I refuse to. I feel like I would just have to inform everyone that I lost it. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I could possibly get an opportunity this good. Why would they pick me? Undoubtedly I have peers that are just as smart if not smarter. They obviously will realise that before July or something totally improbable like the position just being eliminated from the organisation. 

Irrationally I feel like I only got it as a small good happening to us after something so horribly painful. Like there‚Äôs a scale to balance my pain and happiness and it‚Äôs being tipped slightly.

I think my CV it looked good in my younger days (though of course, what does ""good"" really mean?). Still, during my masters thesis I had quite the problem with anxiety -- I felt like I am basically stealing my supervisors time (a feeling, which I yet admittedly did not fully shake). No I am thinking about applying to postdocs and I feel really anxious particularly about asking for references. Like what if my former supervisors my think it me a leech? Also I am very unsure about the whole postdoc business.  


Is there a way to shake these feelings? Currently, friends and colleagues think I am ok (my advisor is actually quite positive, which makes me quite distrustful). On the other hand, it is easy to find CVs in the internet that make mine pale in comparison. Now, I know that these are biased by the way I find the CVs (basically by looking up the authors of papers I like). For me the question is, whether there is a way to estimate my own worth.

4000,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me ‚Äúthere were people who did not want to employ you‚Äù and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either ‚ÄúI think you are an idiot‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are now fired‚Äù. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...‚Äù. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn‚Äôt 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It‚Äôs silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don‚Äôt remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager‚Äôs manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I‚Äôve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it‚Äôs ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",Hi 2 year ago got job Fortune 500 company previously worked small scale startup huge jump excited start felt confident made first day Aaaaand started meeting people team would go something like hey name Adamfiction software engineer master x PhD worked IBM awarded insert achievement Aaaaand realised huge change culture culture shock every day daunting started feeling small used shame think accomplishment good enough would thing everyone work age somehow made much worse would talk meeting someone ask opinion would agree someone instead saying anything scared sound stupid One day line manager told ‚Äú people want employ ‚Äù comment needed reinforce belief around incompetence started actively avoiding colleague thought conversation would go either ‚Äú think idiot ‚Äù ‚Äú fired ‚Äù Saying seems insane time real one colleague invited talk corner booth started shaking convinced day fired lose everything laugh one team meeting said something along line ‚Äú new recent graduate might good idea ‚Äù head team pulled aside noticed imposter syndrome noticed avoiding people avoiding expressing saying thing way sound guarded introduced peer felt started changed life Finally someone relate first meeting started talking struggle cried 30 min telling feel worthless like supposed like hired mistake quota suggested get therapist something well took year month overcome come back every However try remember thing help feel better 1 reason selected among 100 people 2 work good important bit weird keep log thank emailsmessages get good outcome feel everything stupid read remember ‚Äô 3 Remember people different path ‚Äô silly since assume everyone age seems always accomplished remember start career try imagine people start career 4 People often ‚Äô remember conversation even think said something stupid chance walk away forget dwell week write script head prepare future conversation person 5 Rank important think someone line manager ‚Äô manager celebrity scared talk 6 Everybody start somewhere started tracking learned look back see far ‚Äô come 7 Might cultural thing ‚Äô ok acknowledge achievement mean bragging 8 engineer way people see 9 Asking question talking people sigh weakness 10 Sharing experience one easiest way build relationship,trust
4001,"Ive had this job for a year, and I really don't know what the fuck im actually doing. I have such a hard time focusing on my work and I feel like I make a lot of mistakes. I haven't been fired yet simply because we are understaffed.

I am so anxious all the time that I'll lose my job but I'm kind of bad at it and I really dont feel like I belong there. Which definitely feeds into my paranoia a lot, it only gets worse every day. I often find myself getting worn down by putting up this act. My job feels like just doing nothing all day and its tourturing me i feel like im trapped in a cement box. I also know that my company would probably be fine with removing my department and spreading out the tasks to the other departments.

I don't know how to calm myself down about this.

4007,"I know I have the imposter syndrome. I also know I am not doing my best to stay as sharp in my field as I could be (so many unread articles, ugh)...(I say as I have a full-day training I‚Äôm psyched to attend in 6 hours) [sarcasm/not sarcasm...I‚Äôm looking forward to the training but I‚Äôm  up waaaay too late]

My job can be VERY stressful and risky and needs lots of split-second judgments sometimes. I made one, I can back it up, but it caused conflict and I was prob not 100% in the right in how I did it...which leads me to start doubting myself completely. And there was another tense convo where I had to advocate for myself when I was getting some pushback earlier this week...which is tough for me to do as a person, but it made me second guess myself as a professional. But again, I thiiink I‚Äôm doing the best I can there, and if it‚Äôs an issue, it‚Äôs more about my approach vs efficacy (like getting a deep tissue massage vs reiki). 

It seems this is more a gripe-post than anything. I have felt like I‚Äôve sucked all my life but got awards when I was in school and tons of praise and referrals in my work and good feedback from many clients. But I can sometimes recognize I‚Äôm skilled and competent. Sometimes.  (However, when I made it to the fancy wind ensemble in band in hs, I was convinced it was bc the director thought I made districts the year before...but I hadn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd only tried out...and then he gave me first chair which I still question a teeny bit despite it being like 22 years ago). I just don‚Äôt know if I need to step away from my profession sometimes because my self-doubt doesn‚Äôt seem fair to my clients. Who am I to think I can actually help them? Especially when I get that outlier criticism, it just hits right in the sore spot. And it hits so hard I don‚Äôt know if I can even handle continuing in a job that feels so Important. 

I know tomorrow will be another day. And I can try again To do well tomorrow.

I was upset because I couldn't believe he could trust someone like me and that I stole his trust.

And all of that makes me sick because I feel like I stole it from someone more geniune and honest than me. How could a lying rat like me get away with this? He shouldn't, and I'm terrified of the day when someone's going to see right through me. And yet I kind of hope I do because I truly feel I do not deserve this and that its wasted on me.

4027,"I finished my bachelor's degree,magna cum laude, from a relatively unknown university in my country, got top marks in the medical admission exam and was accepted into one of the top medical schools in the country. Felt imposter syndrome ever since after seeing my grades in med school were average or possibly even below average compared to my peers who all graduated from top universities. I kept wondering that maybe I just lucked out on the medical admission exam and that I only graduated with honors cause I graduated from an unknown university. If I'd studied at one of the major league schools like my peers, perhaps I wouldn't have performed as well. Kept thinking that I didn't belong in med school after doing well enough in 1st yr to get an academic scholarship but then losing it in 2nd yr. Told myself the important thing is that I'm a 3rd yr now.   


I really believe that I shouldn't compare myself to others. We all have our own paths. We all went through different stuff, we all have different personalities, different circumstances, different environments, and yet I can't help but be bothered by this.

I have this friend who went to the same unknown university I did. She graduated a year after I did and also got magna cum laude, and got the EXACT SAME SCORE I got in the medical admission exam. She also ranked second in the national licensure exam of her profession.   


She went to the same med school I did, and is now a 1st yr, whereas I'm a 3rd yr. I learned recently that she consistently tops their exams, amidst her peers who, like me, finished from top universities. I can't help but feel that this only reinforces my own imposter syndrome. If my friend who went to the same unknown university as I did, performed as well as me, even getting the exact same honor and exact same score in the medical admission test I did, yet she's performing spectacularly in med school whereas I'm now below average, then it only means I really did just luck out on my achievements so far.

I'm an incoming med student. I was just introduced to the idea of the imposter syndrome when a friend talked about it. I can certainly feel that my current achievements in my undergraduate course--my honors standing, my acceptance into my top med school choice, my plausible scholarship to said school, my research being selected into a national competition--are nothing compared to what I'll experience in med school.

I've been trying to get to my dream job for 10 years - becoming a creative director for an ad agency that deals with non-profits/govt. I'm pretty close currently - I'm a creative lead for an agency that does work for transportation clients, which can include the govt. I like the overall atmosphere but...

I've been here for 3 months now. The first big project I've had is a branding project for an organization's program. We presented concepts to the client and while they didn't completely freak out and call it OMGZ AMAZING, they were still really well received and they liked it. 

My supervisor doesn't feel it's enough. She wants them to basically freak out with joy when they see our work, because that's what they've done in the past. So much that, she got an OK from our CEO to hire an art director as a freelancer and she starts Monday. I feel pretty defeated/rejected/unworthy at this point - everything I've tried working for in this field just feels like it's been for nothing, and at this point I don't know what I'm doing being a creative anymore. I'm not good enough. 

The reason this hits me so hard is because overall I have had a hard time keeping a job for the same exact reason - I've never been enough for a company. I don't know what I can do anymore. I have never felt like I am good enough in this field, but it's the only thing I know. While my job doesn't get that I'm overloaded and don't have the bandwidth to think as strategically as they want me to, it just doesn't matter.

Anyway, people keep complimenting my abilities, saying my piano playing is wonderful or I can draw really well or my dancing is really nice, but I feel like all of my accomplishments are just prepared and fake. When people say ""you can dance"" they are looking at a choreographed, practiced dance routine in a musical that I spent months learning. What they think, though, is that that'll translate to being able to freestyle dance or ballroom dance on a whim. The same goes for piano: some people can walk up to a piano with no plan and improvise a wonderful tune, while I spend a year learning two songs and can't improvise to save my life. People don't seem to get that so I get a lot of praise on things when all I'm doing is following instructions.

4034,"Ok, am I right or am I right that of the types of ""imposters"" there are, the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist"" types are absolutely the most screwed, pwahaha ([https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one))? Think about it. For the other imposter types listed, even if internally they feel like a mess, there are still some external benefits to their internal insecurity.

1. The perfectionist will still strive for that 100%. Even if they do miss that 1%, they are still going to probably be 99% better than most people.
2. The superwoman/man will work harder than anyone else. Even if they are insecure, their efforts show up in their work and gain them respect.
3. The expert gathers every piece of information and knowledge that they can. Even if their knowledge is incomplete, they still know more than probably the average person.

But the ""natural genius"" and ""soloist""? Lord help them. And by Lord help them, I mean Lord help me LMAO.

1. The soloist is fighting a losing battle. They are trying to go it alone WHILE also trying to be perfect. We all need mentors and teachers to help us to learn things! People will think that you are arrogant because you are trying to learn things on your own. And you most likely will also fail because who can succeed without the help of others?
2. And the ""natural genius""? Oh my goodness, this is even worse! Think about it: this person (me, lmao) delusionally thinks that they can excel WHILE on minimal effort AND on their first try. They give up easily at the sign of any challenge, because that's a sign that they aren't ""good"" or ""talented"" or ""smart"" enough. Therefore, they never actually excel at anything.

I feel like the first three (perfectionist, superwomen/man, expert) are almost like ""productive"" imposters. People that feel like imposters, but at least do something about it that can somewhat productively counteract those feelings.

But the bottom two, which I unfortunately am? It's like where you feel like you are an imposter, and instead of at the very least compensating for it, you just try to hide it... by trying to go it alone so that no one can see your imperfections at least for a short while (soloist) or by only ever sticking to things that are ""easy"" so that you can pretend like you are some sort of ""natural genius"" of some sort. 

Not to say that any of these are objectively supposed to be considered as ""good."" But I guess I'm just a little bit frustrated with myself...

4035,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn‚Äôt put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn‚Äôt. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family‚Äôs and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if‚Äôs. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it‚Äôs why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I‚Äôve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what‚Äôs looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don‚Äôt look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it‚Äôs offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don‚Äôt have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We‚Äôll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don‚Äôt feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don‚Äôt treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven‚Äôt earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn‚Äôt earn it, that‚Äôs bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that‚Äôs where you go so ride it out. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don‚Äôt go down the dark hole there‚Äôs nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

4042,"The dictionary defines self-awareness as ‚Äúknowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.‚Äù 

When you‚Äôre self-aware, you have an accurate and clear understanding of your character, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs and sense of self. You know what your life is about, you know how others perceive you and the effect you have on them.

Why does it matter?

Your level of self-awareness influences the key pillars in your life ‚Äì your relationships, career, personal development and overall wellbeing.

¬∑ Self-awareness is necessary for taking control of your life. The direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and reactions. Self-awareness is the principal way of understanding and influencing these things. When you take control, you have choices.

¬∑ Self-awareness identifies un-resourceful beliefs and emotional reactions that stand in your way and gives you the power to make adjustments ‚Äì personal growth.

¬∑ Self-awareness can lead to a greater understanding of past setbacks and challenges. We can conveniently dismiss our failures as bad luck or a lack of proper timing. But it‚Äôs also possible that we failed to perceive the situation, others, or ourselves accurately. It‚Äôs much easier to see the reason behind relationship, work, and other struggles when we can look at ourselves honestly.

¬∑ Self-awareness is critical for successful leadership. Leaders with an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses are able to build teams that compensate those weaknesses and leverage the strengths.

¬∑ Self-awareness is the foundation for personal growth. Without it, any personal development efforts will be severely hampered ‚Äì as if you‚Äôre building on sand.  
   
 

# How Can I Develop Self-Awareness?

¬∑ **Develop the habit of Noticing your thoughts.** Our minds are constantly churning through ideas and endlessly providing commentary. Becoming aware of these thoughts, and noticing the common themes gives the potential for encouraging more resourceful self-talk.

‚óã Notice your thinking patterns. What are you thinking when you‚Äôre feeling nervous? Bored? Interested? Walking down the street? ‚Äì what does this mean for you?

‚óã Do you judge people and situations? Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future? Do you expect the worst to happen or the best? Or do you adopt an open attitude of, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just see what happens‚Äù?

¬∑ **Notice your feelings.** What are you feeling throughout the day? What do you feel while you‚Äôre eating? Driving to work? Lying in bed? Waiting in line?

‚óã As you notice each emotion, question it. What am I feeling? Why? What do I need right now? How do I normally react in this situation? Is this resourceful for me? 

¬∑ **Reflect on how you deal with frustration or emotional discomfort.** ***A huge chunk of your time is spent trying to make yourself feel better.*** If you feel slightly frustrated or uncomfortable, then you may spend a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to change the situation or the others around you to resolve those negative feelings. Would id be more resourceful to develop your responses ‚Äì which you can control ‚Äì or try to change others ‚Äì who you do not control. 

‚óã Do you try to control others? Do you attempt to distract yourself? Is your first instinct to leave the situation? Do you surf the internet or eat a big bowl of ice cream?

¬∑ **Consider your friendships.** Where do you meet new friends? Are most of your friendships long-term or short? When your friendships end, what is the common cause? What types of people do you prefer to be friends with? What types of people do you avoid?

¬∑ **Consider your intimate relationships.** Do you see patterns in the type of people that you‚Äôve been involved with? What are the common positive and negative characteristics they share? Why do you think those people appealed to you?

‚óã What were your shortcomings in your relationships? Are you clingy? Jealous? Too focused on work? Fail to communicate your needs? Think about how you contributed to the successes and failure of your relationships.

‚óã Have you changed your approach from relationship to relationship, or do you continue to repeat the same patterns?

¬∑ **Keep a journal.** This is a highly effective way to learn about yourself by recording your thoughts, feelings, and experiences each day. Be sure to include your high and low points for the day.

‚óã Note how well you ate and slept, too. Sleep ‚Äì especially changes in sleeping patterns - can elicit very valuable information about what is going on. 

‚óã Create a habit of writing in your journal for at least 15 minutes each day. You‚Äôll start to notice patterns and learn a lot about yourself.

¬∑ **Reflect on your core values.** Think about and then document your core values, goals and intentions. You might be surprised by what you write. This is a great first step for understanding yourself and your beliefs.

¬∑ **Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses.** How do you know? Are you certain? Avoid jumping to conclusions. You may have always believed that you‚Äôre a hard worker, but are you? To whom are you comparing yourself? Provide yourself with proof before you make any decisions. Are you noticing any limiting beliefs ‚Äì I‚Äôm not good enough, I‚Äôm not worthy?

¬∑ **What would others say about you?** Consider how your partner, children, friends, family, co-workers, and boss would describe you. What would they suggest you improve about yourself? How do you respond to thinking about what others think about you?

¬∑ **Trance.** Meditation is all about developing a better awareness of the present moment and yourself. *Meditation is an ideal activity for enhancing self-awareness. Hypnosis / Self-hypnosis is all about using the trance state to support your general wellbeing and specific outcomes.*

‚óã Meditate at least once each day. Spend the rest of the day paying attention to yourself, others, and your surroundings. You can develop a higher degree of self-awareness by just paying attention.

4044,"I have a Masters in computer science from a relatively prestigious school, and I‚Äôve received praise and awards from respected tech companies.

But‚Ä¶ all I hear are the words of three people:


My Dad - When I got into a top program for a Ph.D in Computer Science he was only disappointed I didn‚Äôt get into MIT.  

When I placed at the top of my college class and won a faculty award for my senior project, he later criticized it saying his idea would have been better and that it didn‚Äôt go anywhere (it did, later years based their work on mine).



My Professor - I wrote a thesis for an honors program, and he was supposed to read and give feedback.  My primary professor loved it and praised me.

This other professor said he wasn‚Äôt convinced, said the entire field (unconventional computing) is a waste, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to get a Ph.D unless you‚Äôre someone ‚Äúlike Hawking or Einstein‚Äù.  He himself was a Harvard grad, and his words really took a toll on me.



My Best Friend - Just regularly puts me down.. calls me ugly, never celebrates my accomplishments and criticizes me instead.  I always do my best to give him support and rarely criticize his work (the rest of the world does that enough).  

But, it feels like he needs to make me feel inferior.  One time I met some new friends, both with a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù  C.S. background, and we started a project together.  My friend immediately snapped and said ‚Äúwell they‚Äôre obviously smarter than you‚Äù.



I just have this constant stream of echos in my head, mostly from these three people, and it kills my confidence.

But, what if they‚Äôre right?  Should I thank them for stopping me from pursuing my dreams with more confidence?

4049,"Why now? Why not 14 years ago when I was still a wide-eyed and green junior developer?

It took several discussions with my wife to finally drill down to the reasons. First, my parents taught me perfectionism and that either you're a winner or loser. It's been haunting me ever since, and is probably the root of my Imposter Syndrome. I have this built in mechanism that shuts me down unless I'm at the top of the food chain. Next, the field of cyber security is one of immense talent, and it's honestly becoming very hard not to compare myself with my coworkers. Especially when your bonus is tied to performance and feedback. It gets to the point where my performance anxiety halts any progress I was attempting on a project. And now I'm stressing about my performance evaluations... So why did I choose this job, well it's because I want to be seen as ""the expert"", so I choose difficult jobs that force me to learn. It worked for over a decade until I've reached this point. It's like the Dilbert Principle but applied to anxiety.

I'm at the point where I'm considering taking a massive pay cut just so I don't need to perform; like a boring job fixing shitty bugs in obsolete enterprise code. 

How the hell do people grapple with this? I've been told to ignore those intrusive thoughts and instead focus on accomplishments. I've read about mindfulness. I tried not giving a fuck. But it all seems like a minor speed bump, and the IS always comes sneaking up on me.

Eventually, things got so bad I went to DHS for help getting my life on track and they paid for me to get my GED and go to college for medical assisting.

4069,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

4070,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I work in academia, and I'm well familiar with people who are struggling with impostor syndrome.

My personal impression is that the most common type around me is women who feel like they never work enough and then overwork themselves and become bitter and serious. It's a serious condition.

# My problem

**However**, lately I'm thinking if imposter syndrome is actually my problem.

My issue is, on the surface, *the opposite*. I find it hard to do any work at all. As soon as I face the smallest wall that I have to jump over (metaphorically speaking), I won't do any more work that day.

I find it hard doing even a half hour of work a day. Or finish anything else in my life.

Let me start by saying I believe I've had imposter syndrome for as long as I can remember (going back to elementary school and believing I was not at the same level as my school peers).

&#x200B;

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job. I've been working on my resume (obsessing mostly), trying to perfect it, sell myself as best I can without over-selling. My father says I need to just start applying but I am just so anxious that any job I get with some responsibility, I'll end up failing.

&#x200B;

I do suffer from anxiety and OCD, so I'm basically always already doubting myself. The thing is, through experience, I tend to overthink situations. I have for as long as I can remember. But in the end, things that I've overthought tend to not be as scary as I've made them in my mind.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

4083,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",Hello first post Im wondering belongs Going back rough childhood always felt like havent really anything get lot youth Ive felt like didnt really anything belong worked moving past However barely adult 18 started journey feel day faking dont belong started work chain coffee shop ended dating one coworkers dating ended quitting started work food truck odds end able get shift working job brake good term stood friend continued help already met family still really good term well went different direction completely changed life dont want give many detail privacy reason basically Grandma working contractor client needed full time accountant daughter also worked client full time employee two running basically financial aspect swamped needed help Im fresh high school working first semester college reach guess GM started accounting really young dad taught daughter around 15 ish GM knew client wanted someone experience help didnt want pay said experience GM also bad experience college grad thought knew everything didnt listen direction GM interviewed basically said look saw work EXBF know hard worker opportunity pretend experience highschool etc would teach everything needed know True word GM amazing taught almost everything know amazing human helped treated like family entire time Unfortunately client wasnt best left GM actually vouched going back Highschool taught worked 2 different position accounting paper experience real life experience give take year 18 Ive field year found lot people field havent gone school life experience thing going back first extended offer long even opportunity felt wrong Like lying amazing family accepting didnt feel right reason Im forever grateful still contact haunted somehow lied cheated way life got accepted first lease boyfriend got key last week Im paying car able buy feel way range two pet pretty good place would like think feel wrong like didnt anything get Like someone going figure lied get dont know Im Im fake took job people work get,trust

4089,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling with intrusive and negative thought about myself for more than 4 years now and I just can‚Äôt deal with it no more. I want to reduce my symptoms but I have yet failed to do so. There is a naut in my reasoning and I need to undo but I need help.

So I consider myself pretty lucky. I have good parents, I have always done good at school during childhood. I guess I always had an underlying anxiety issue because at age 15, I could bare a break up and tried (unsuccessfully-thanks lord) to end my life. This depressive period change something in me because I started to put way more importance and attention to my grades. In college, I was often 20% above average in my class, gpa (R score) way above the mean. Yet, I always aimed to get higher, never satisfied. Always giving more than requested in evaluations, making myself almost on the verge of burn out but the adrenaline kept pushing me. In my music recital, I would cry or get mad after my performance because I made mistakes I didn‚Äôt do when rehearsing, my music teacher feeling bad for me. When I did good, I always felt awkward, putting it on chance, trying to hide/deviate the conversation.

Then last year, I got in the undergraduate program I wanted (cognitive neuroscience) and everything got worst. I‚Äôm (now doubting) aiming to enter a PhD program, so does the majority of my 500 classmates, but only 12 places are available. The teachers had to put fire under our ass : ‚Äúgrades are not enough‚Äù, ‚Äúyou need to have above 4/4.3 of gpa, get hundreds of hours in research and clinical experience, win scholarships, publish‚Äù. I got scared, but for real, but I already knew this : before even starting my program I had already contacted researcher to join their lab. Week 2 of my bachelor : I had researcher assistant position. But I felt like a total incompetent and intrude. I never been in a lab in my entire life, didn‚Äôt pass a single exam and I got it almost first shot. So that was both scary and unpleasant. When I went to ask a question on a programming class to my neuroanatomy teacher for my job, he told the entire class (250 persons) that ‚Äúone of your colleagues already had a research job so everyone of you should hurry up because place at PhD are limited‚Äù. The entire class released a surprise ‚Äúahh.. omg‚Äù I was humiliated (my ears turned red), wanted to burry myself 6 feet under. But now I felt the pressure, because my classmate started to recognize me.

1 year later, I got coauthorship for an article published in A famous Journal. I don‚Äôt feel I own it : I feel like an intrude. I didn‚Äôt wrote a single line of it, I was just there to help with the analysis, put comments and correct it. I feel like it was a huge gift from the postdoc and director that mentor me. The article got accepted in first round because he did an incredible work. Not only it is rare to publish as an undergraduate : it is rare to publish it that journal and it is rare that it get accepted first round. I feel uncomfortable. I feel now the bar is set so, so high. Failure is at my door and I‚Äôm scare to disappoint them. My director wants me to prepare a presentation on my ‚Äúperspective on my first redaction experience, and give tips to trainee‚Äù (when I‚Äôm the youngest trainee in the entire team). I legitimately don‚Äôt know what to say: I feel and felt like an intruder for the entire process.

My classmates and colleague relly heavily on me and seem to except that I know everything, but I don‚Äôt. My director gave me a graduate level project to take over and I‚Äôve been freezing for 3 month because I don‚Äôt know how to manage it. I don‚Äôt even know what I want to do of my life anymore but I feel I have to act like I do, at least for being a model to my classmate that don‚Äôt stop asking me question to get to my position. but I have almost no one my age to rely on in return. Mentor already projecting me publicly growing in academia but I feel stupid and so not creative compare to them. I didn‚Äôt do my math (calculus, linear algebra) and now I feel like an handicapped student.

4101,"Hi all,

I'm here to share my story and wondering if anyone has any advice... a long post ahead (apologies).

I moved to a new country in mid 2018 with a job in a field I wanted to be in.

Prior to my move overseas, I was doing pretty ok at my job and enjoyed it well enough to keep going everyday.  I entered into the field as a graduate and did pretty well there. My job involves analytical thinking and using numbers on a daily basis. At school, math has never been my forte and I've always felt a sense of anxiety towards it for a number of reasons (e.g shamed in front of peers, parental pressure etc.). However, when I moved overseas and got a job in the same field, things started to go downhill.

The overseas job was fundamentally similar to what I was previously doing, but much more complex and customised work. I was making errors and mistakes on basic stuff. My anxiety increased exponentially and everyday I felt like I was going to be revealed as someone who is incompetent. I did my very best and worked really hard to double, triple check my work but it was a cycle of stress and anxiety as I felt less confident and would catastrophize every situation in my head (e.g. I'm going to get fired then get deported...) Coupled with the fact that my boss was a grammar nazi and had really strong eye for detail... I lasted a year and a half before I was let go.  Self sabotage much!

(I also have to note that my errors never led to any projects fallen apart, nor did we loose any clients over my work. It was the small things that added up to the whole.)

It was a tough time because I felt like an absolute failure. My boss and my colleagues had finally discovered the ""truth"" about me...

I've been lucky to get a job relatively quickly since then as I was already looking for other roles before I was let go, but feel like the situation could end up similarly if I don't change and overcome this ASAP. I've already found myself making a few simple errors and this has triggered some anxiety again.

I'm working through some parts of it through a therapist (there's a host of other issues relating to self confidence and childhood trauma which are all connected), but not sure if I can financially sustain it in the long run.

There are a few things I have been working on to try and manage and stay in control.  For example, I'm actively trying to improve my mathematical ability regularly, keep a check list of 'must-dos', exercising regularly to manage my thoughts. Since going into the new job I've tried my best do things differently to what I did before even on simple tasks. I've told my self that it's my 'system of working' that's not working - not a fundamental judgement of my ability and self.

What I do enjoy about the job is that it gives me experience to work on interesting projects and have an impact.

My plan is to stay for a minimum of one year in this new role while I try to find something else.  At the end, perhaps I'm just not suited to this job... Or am I just having a hard time letting go? Am I really an imposter?

Any thoughts or advice to manage all of this? :) It would be really welcomed and appreciated!",Hi Im share story wondering anyone advice long post ahead apology moved new country mid 2018 job field wanted Prior move overseas pretty ok job enjoyed well enough keep going everyday entered field graduate pretty well job involves analytical thinking using number daily basis school math never forte Ive always felt sense anxiety towards number reason eg shamed front peer parental pressure etc However moved overseas got job field thing started go downhill overseas job fundamentally similar previously much complex customised work making error mistake basic stuff anxiety increased exponentially everyday felt like going revealed someone incompetent best worked really hard double triple check work cycle stress anxiety felt le confident would catastrophize every situation head eg Im going get fired get deported Coupled fact bos grammar nazi really strong eye detail lasted year half let go Self sabotage much also note error never led project fallen apart loose client work small thing added whole tough time felt like absolute failure bos colleague finally discovered truth Ive lucky get job relatively quickly since already looking role let go feel like situation could end similarly dont change overcome ASAP Ive already found making simple error triggered anxiety Im working part therapist there host issue relating self confidence childhood trauma connected sure financially sustain long run thing working try manage stay control example Im actively trying improve mathematical ability regularly keep check list mustdos exercising regularly manage thought Since going new job Ive tried best thing differently even simple task Ive told self system working thats working fundamental judgement ability self enjoy job give experience work interesting project impact plan stay minimum one year new role try find something else end perhaps Im suited job hard time letting go really imposter thought advice manage would really welcomed appreciated,trust

4115,"I just wanted to get this out because reading through what I need to do for my graduation next week has got me all kinds of anxious.

Essentially, I feel like I've just been pretending to be smart my entire way through university. Like all I've been doing is just copying information from sources.

Even my dissertation. I just feel like I took information from organic chemistry books and websites and that I don't actually deserve any credit because if I hadn't had resources I wouldn't have been able to have done it. It's like I believe that if I didn't just *know* something without having to research it first that I don't really know it at all, even if I made sure I understood everything before I wrote about it.

It doesn't help that I have a terrible memory. So I often have to look stuff up, even if I know it. I just feel like I'm not actually an intelligent individual and I'm just really good at pretending to be. I look at other people who're graduating from the same course as me and think they must know more than me or they must actually deserve it compared to what I've been doing.

Now I'm not at uni anymore and I'm applying for jobs, I'm terrified that I'm not capable of working in the industry I've been studying for the last 3 years. The longer I spend applying for jobs and not hearing anything back, the worse I feel, because there's obviously a reason why nobody's responding to my applications.

I just feel like I've been given a good degree for lying about being smart and that now I'm not going to be able to use it and I just spent ¬£27k on something I'm going to have on my wall whilst I work in a supermarket because I can't get a job anywhere else.

4117,"I'm 20 years old now, grew up being told I was smart, have talents and even won an award in 7th grade called most likely to be a millionaire. My mom hangs it proudly in the house for show. She smiles when she looks at it.

Since then I went on to play chess at a national level, my first tournament I did poorly. The whole time, feeling like I was gonna be exposed, that my district wasn't good enough, that these smarter more intelligent kids would find me out. I capitulated. After that, my dad got drunk, told me I wasted his money and I never played it again. To this day.

And that's been a theme for me ever since. Since the age of 15. Had a bad bout of depression that seemed to come from nowhere, got into drugs and such, meth, codeine and self destruction. Got lucky, studied hard and went to college and now I'm 2 years clean.

But I'm still suffering the same thing. I no longer have the confidence to speak in a group of people, I always fear that they will remark something true about me. Figure me out before I finish.

Can't make many friends neither, they always seem to find out how weak I am and take advantage of me. Especially with women, I'm black so I date black girls. If you know black girls you know how mean they can be. Or maybe that's how I want to think of them.

They say I'm not bad looking, so girls sometimes get attracted to me. When they do I panic. Not because I'm scared of them, I've had girlfriends before but broke it off before they got too near. When girls want me I run away, I'm so afraid that they'll know what I'm all about. That I'm just a smoke screen for nothing that lies behind, hollow as can be.

Can't even walk in public in peace, always feel like somebody can see through me. I don't know how to explain it, sometimes people remark things that cut to the core.

Been called many things that were true. I can't even be around my step family, probably only 4 people in the world I can be myself around. Even then I think they're just entertaining me, laughing at me in secret. Criticising me. Maybe.

4118,"I didn't always have the self-esteem to claim that I was an intelligent person, but throughout my childhood, adolescence, and early youth, I did have some flashes of brilliance that made me feel confident in my abilities.

I could give details, but I'll spare them, I'll just say that I was a good student, and I got things out without much trouble, but above all, I think I was good at things that were hard to quantify, like the ability to relate different concepts in an original way., creativity, etc

I did a degree in chemistry without much passion and with many doubts, and I used that as an excuse for my poor performance. As a consequence of this, I did a master's degree in applied statistics at a low-profile university.

Due to my grades I thought it would be difficult for me to find a job, but I quickly got a position as an engineer, and two years later I am still in the same company where I have a position with a high technical profile.

In my day to day I obviously interact with my team, where at the level of academic trajectory, I am clearly at the bottom, if not in the last place. It is also common to interact with similar profiles from other companies, I usually look for them on linkedin and generally these people have brilliant careers, being tops in their degrees and with phds from very good universities.

Where I want to get at is that I feel like I ended up here by sheer miracle or by a whim of fate. If I have to be honest, I get to understand the concepts that I work on, but I feel that sometimes it is more difficult for me than others.

4120,"Quick, who is your favorite author?

One of my favorite authors right now is Michael Wickett. He's an accomplished Nightingale-Conant motivational speaker and author. His book, ***It's All Within Your Reach*** is one of the best I've ever read.

I hold him in high regard because of that book.

Most, if not all of us, feel the same way when it comes to authors. Statistically speaking, about 80 percent of the American population wants to write a book, but so few embark on this journey. If I had to guess, I would probably say that many people do not believe they have what it takes to write a book, which, at the root is simply fear. But, I once heard Les Brown say, ‚ÄúWhen your why is big enough, you will find you how.‚Äù

I‚Äôm going to lay out 10 reasons why you should write a book and maybe, just maybe after you read them, you will find you how, and if not, I promise to help you.

## Reason #1: A book is an instant confidence booster

As I mentioned at the outset, how do you normally feel about authors? Do you treat them differently from the average person? What sort of impression do you get when you're introduced to an author?

When people perceive you in a high and elevated way, you begin to feel better about yourself. It‚Äôs an instant confidence booster. Most people treat authors as celebrities. And imagine if your book hits Amazon's #1 Best-Seller Status. What would that do to your confidence and self-esteem?

I know I felt great when mine hit that status. Not in a prideful or boastful way, but just proud of myself and what I‚Äôve accomplished since the death of my mom. I know she would be proud of me as well.

## Reason #2: A book allows you to see your value and potential

Author John Maxwell said, ‚ÄúMany people fail to grow and reach their potential because of low self-esteem.‚Äù

When I was depressed and contemplating suicide, my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I could not see any value or worth in my life. But I was motivated by the thought of a postage stamp and so I began to add value to my life, first by exchanging my negative thinking for more positive ones, I began to exercise, eat healthier and start back fellowshipping with my congregation.

When I began to write, I learned to get out of my head and to see my real potential and value as a human being. If you don‚Äôt realize you have genuine value or that you're worth investing in, then you‚Äôll never put in the time or effort required to grow.

One of my favorite motivational speakers Zig Ziglar said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with how we see ourselves. We can positively do very few things if we feel negative about ourselves.‚Äù

I know for a fact, that every aspect of our lives is directly impacted by the way we see ourselves. When you write and pour out your heart onto paper, you see how far you‚Äôve gotten in life, and all that you've accomplished.

## Reason #3: Writing a book is an opportunity for self-reflection

Have you ever gone to therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. Going to therapy helped me cope with being sexually molested as a young girl. Well, I get that same type of help every time I sit down to write. Writing allows you to dig deep within yourself. You are alone and vulnerable and you're able to work things out on paper that you can‚Äôt do when they stay locked up in your head.

Writing forces you to reflect on your life. Most of the time, when we take the time to self-reflect, we see patterns that we need to change and habits we need to develop.

When I was in the fifth grade, my amazing teacher, Mrs. Battle brought a snake into the classroom and we had the privilege of seeing the snake shed its skin. It was the absolute most captivating thing I‚Äôd seen at that time. When I write, I also see myself shedding my old skin, my old thinking, and my old dishonoring ways for a newer, better version of me.

Writing has allowed me to change my life and the byproduct of that is I‚Äôve changed the way I think about myself. I no longer see myself as a victim. I am strong and unbreakable. By the way, so are you.

Our lives are so hectic. Learning to pause allows growth to catch up to you.

## Reason #4: Writing a book allows you to flex your brain power

Did you know that our brains weigh about three pounds? It is such a small organ, yet it packs a punch. When you write, even when you're writing your own story, inevitably you will have to do some research, whether that be interviewing your family members or hopping onto Google to get some facts or now, AI ChatGPT.

Our brains are muscles. Just like any muscle it needs to be flexed or it will atrophy. Writing allows you to flex your brain. When you step outside of your comfort zone you give yourself a chance to explore new things about yourself. One new point discovered can lead to other points and you never know where that can take you. I‚Äôve learned that to be a success, you first have to think it and the only way you start to think it is, either you change or something in your life forces you to change.

Nothing in life remains the same forever.

Writing helps you to determine your future. You can write your ticket in life or continually allow someone else to force you to write theirs. Stop thinking in terms of ‚ÄúCan I‚Äù and start thinking in terms of ‚ÄúHow Can I.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow Can I‚Äù puts a different spin on things. It‚Äôs the beginning of a high-value question that prompts you to figure it out. Start asking the right questions and your brain will begin to give you better answers.

## Reason #5: A book is an ideal way to create side-hustle income

Most people that I come into contact with would love to someday work for themselves, whether it's for financial freedom or just because they want to spend more time at home with their family.

When you write a book and you get the title of #1 best-selling author attached to you, people are going to take notice.

Published authors are considered experts and authorities in their field. If you had a book, do you think you could send that book to a business prospect? How do you think you would be perceived by that person? Would it be difficult to land that contract? I don‚Äôt think so.

Writing a book positions you as an authority. This fact can help you sell more products and services which will ultimately impact your bottom line.

Would you like to earn more money just by writing a book?

That would be a yes for me too.

Just think, what if you were allowed to get paid for sharing with other people information you already know?

Now, perhaps unlike at any other time in history, if you possess knowledge that other people would be willing to pay for, you can start making money, with little or no startup costs, especially with the help of AI.

Teaching online grants you the freedom to still work a day job yet generate side-hustle income. Today, it‚Äôs a real possibility to even make just as much money while you're asleep as when you're awake, thanks to the power of the Internet and AI.

You have the opportunity to teach and share what you're most passionate about with large audiences. Would you like to share what you love and be paid for doing so?

So now are you beginning to see how finally earning what you‚Äôre worth by sharing your knowledge and expertise with others would help boost your self-confidence and self-esteem?

## Reason #6: A book will help you get over your fears, even your fear of public speaking

Have you ever noticed that authors are usually asked to speak at conferences or seminars? Well, my friend, the same will be true for you. I know, but you‚Äôre afraid of speaking, right?

Well, the only way to face any fear is to stand up to it. We overcome our fears by doing the thing that we fear. Here are three other ways to overcome fear:

* Define your fear. When we face new situations in life, we normally imagine the worst-case scenario. But, did you know that you can dramatically shrink your fears by simply putting them into words on a piece of paper? See how writing helps you to slay fear.
* Accept the challenges that fear presents to you. Instead of shrinking back and giving fear the upper hand, accept fear as a normal part and life and act despite it. A great tool from author and speaker Mel Robbins of The 5 Second Rule, really works. Try it. When you want to do something, just count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and then do the thing that you fear. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ‚ÄúDo one thing every day that scares you.‚Äù
* Think of the benefits of acting in the face of your fear. Think of what it will do for your self-esteem and self-confidence. A good exercise is to physically write down the benefits you will gain by forging ahead. The thing to remember is that every decision you make is helping to form the person you are becoming. Do you want your fear to define you or do you want to take that scary risk and come off the victor?

## Reason #7: A book will help you be more productive by raising your standards

Do you find that you are easily distracted and not being as productive as you can be? Well, writing a book during a challenge will not only help you with your productivity it will also help you with developing discipline, determination and just plain grit.

When you write a book, it‚Äôs just you, the blank slate, and now AI. Writing helps you remain singularly focused on the task at hand. It is an exercise in discipline and time management. If you stick to it, your determination will give way to a beautiful masterpiece. And no, it doesn‚Äôt have to take months anymore, it can take a weekend. I will show you how to write 10 books in 30 days.

Let me ask you a question, what's the difference between something you should do and something you absolutely must do?

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, ‚ÄúThe things easy to do are also easy not to do.‚Äù In other words, the things you should do are things that are easy not to do and so you don‚Äôt do them. Some of these things are:

I should eat healthier.

I should exercise more.

I should treat my spouse with respect.

But when you absolutely must do something, as if your life depended on it, there is a shift and change in you. If eating healthier meant you would live or die, then you most likely would do it. The same with exercise and treating your spouse with respect, if your life depended on it, you would make the necessary changes.

When you raise your standards and turn ‚Äúshould‚Äù into ‚Äúmust,‚Äù you are making an inner shift to take control over the quality of your life. Any area in which you are not getting what you want is because you haven‚Äôt raised your standards.

According to Tony Robbins, ‚ÄúMost people, if they look at how they are living their lives today, will find that their identity is based on a set of standards and a set of beliefs they created 10, 20, 30 or more years ago. Many of us made decisions when we were kids about what to believe, what we are capable of, and who we are as a person, and that became the glass ceiling that controls us. But are you the same person you were back then? Are you the same person you were even a year ago?‚Äù

I‚Äôm just going to say it, you have to demand excellence from yourself. Don‚Äôt be mediocre. Be world-class. Don‚Äôt settle for the status quo, be relentless. Pursue excellence. ‚ÄúPeople are rewarded in public for what they‚Äôve practiced for years in private,‚Äù said Tony Robbins. Never ever give up. Raise your standards. Writing will help.

## Reason #8: A book will help you develop bullet-proof habits

To complete your book, you have to have good habits, otherwise, you‚Äôll never get it done.

In 2008, after my mom died of colon and liver cancer, a few years later, I developed the habit of getting up at 4 a.m. and going to the gym. That habit has helped and sustained me all these years. I knew I had to do something to get my mind out of the loop of negativity. I knew I had to physically move my body because where my focus goes, energy flows.

With that said, I started researching other high achievers and came across Brendon Burchard. Brendon has been studying high achievers for over 20 years and the biggest secret he has learned when it comes to habits is ‚Äútrigger moments.‚Äù

In essence, trigger moments are cues that remind you to activate your intentions or habits.

I use my iPhone to create my trigger moments. A lot of people underutilize this great feature on their iPhones. Right now, I want you to take your ‚ÄúClock‚Äù then hit ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù and then add your alarm time. Then under ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù write out your goal ‚Äì the same one you have a picture of on your board. Press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. Repeat this step three times for each of your goals. So from now on, every day at that time, you‚Äôll be reminded to accomplish your goals. This is how you attack from all sides. You have the vision board, you have the alarm and now let‚Äôs move on to tip number three.

My all-time favorite bullet-proof habit device is pen and paper. When we track what we do, things get done. As an example, I started using my Apple Watch to track how many steps I take in a day. Before I had this device, I never walked 10,000 steps, but now that I track it, I make sure I do it every day. The same is true with any habit you form. When you write it down and track it, you will see the needle move, your results will encourage you to continue going. This helps to build momentum and you will become unstoppable. Writing has a funny way of doing that.

## Reason #9: A book helps boost your self-esteem and allows you to expect more out of life

Scientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But today, they‚Äôre learning more and more that we respond to what the brain expects to happen next.

Neuropsychologists call it the expectancy theory. Basically, through a lifetime‚Äôs worth of events, our brains learn what to expect next ‚Äì even if it does not happen. And because our brain expects something will happen a certain way, we often achieve exactly what we anticipate.

Do you see the dilemma?

If you don‚Äôt expect much to happen in your life, then, most likely it won‚Äôt. But if you do expect something great to occur, it most likely will. The difference is that you have to believe it will happen to you.

But how do you get that belief?

Simply put, you need to build your confidence.

**Confidence is built through action.**

A great start is simply writing down on a piece of paper, what it is that you want and expect out of life. When you put into words what you are thinking in your head, it becomes real. You now have a way to make a plan and start seeing some forward movement in your life.

In a talk at TEDx San Francisco, Mel Robbins, self-help author of the book, The 5 Second Rule, mentioned that scientists estimate the probability of your being born at about one in 400 trillion.

Do you know what that means?

It means you are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal pride. You are extraordinary. There has never been anyone exactly like you in all history of mankind on the earth. You have amazing untapped talents and abilities that, when properly directed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want or dream of.

In essence, your very existence proves you are a miracle. So start acting like the miracle you are!

In a CD by Earl Nightingale, titled, The Strangest Secret, he says, ‚ÄúYou become what you think about.‚Äù So what are you thinking? What are you constantly feeding your mind on? Your mistakes or your accomplishments?

Your thoughts trigger images and pictures and the emotions that go with them. These images then trigger your attitudes and actions. Therefore, if you think about success, you will feel strong and competent, but when you think about your mistakes, you will inevitably feel sad and weak.

We attract into our lives that which we think about. Whatever our dominant thoughts are, that is what will show up for us in our lives. To have more self-esteem you need to think the thoughts you would be thinking if you were already achieving your goal. Writing is a great place to start.

## Reason #10: A book helps you create and leave a legacy for your friends and loved ones

When my mom died, I wished she would‚Äôve written a book, just a story about every aspect of her life that I failed to ask about. She was an extraordinary woman that I didn‚Äôt have enough time with. I do however have a few of her songs. She was an amazing songwriter, and that‚Äôs where I get my ability to write. Thanks, mom.

When we leave this earth, a few mementos and memories are all we have left of our loved ones. What if you had more? What if you had a book that detailed the lives of your mom, dad, grandparents and more? What if you left that to your children and relatives? How would they feel? How proud would they be? Could it perhaps encourage them to confidently go after their hopes and dreams?

I believe writing a book helps create your legacy. In our digital age, there's no telling who else will be touched and inspired by your thoughts and words. At the outset, I asked who was your favorite author or writer, what if they never wrote down that very thing that inspired you?

I believe we not only owe it to ourselves to write a book, but we owe it to the universe and the generations coming behind us. Do what author Steven Pressfield suggests in his book, The War of Art. In the last pages of his book, he says that if you don‚Äôt do the thing you were meant to do, you, not only hurt yourself, you hurt the planet. He says, **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you got.‚Äù**",Quick favorite author One favorite author right Michael Wickett Hes accomplished NightingaleConant motivational speaker author book Within Reach one best Ive ever read hold

4121,"I have a Masters in computer science from a relatively prestigious school, and I‚Äôve received praise and awards from respected tech companies.

But‚Ä¶ all I hear are the words of three people:


My Dad - When I got into a top program for a Ph.D in Computer Science he was only disappointed I didn‚Äôt get into MIT.  

When I placed at the top of my college class and won a faculty award for my senior project, he later criticized it saying his idea would have been better and that it didn‚Äôt go anywhere (it did, later years based their work on mine).



My Professor - I wrote a thesis for an honors program, and he was supposed to read and give feedback.  My primary professor loved it and praised me.

This other professor said he wasn‚Äôt convinced, said the entire field (unconventional computing) is a waste, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to get a Ph.D unless you‚Äôre someone ‚Äúlike Hawking or Einstein‚Äù.  He himself was a Harvard grad, and his words really took a toll on me.



My Best Friend - Just regularly puts me down.. calls me ugly, never celebrates my accomplishments and criticizes me instead.  I always do my best to give him support and rarely criticize his work (the rest of the world does that enough).  

But, it feels like he needs to make me feel inferior.  One time I met some new friends, both with a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù  C.S. background, and we started a project together.  My friend immediately snapped and said ‚Äúwell they‚Äôre obviously smarter than you‚Äù.



I just have this constant stream of echos in my head, mostly from these three people, and it kills my confidence.

But, what if they‚Äôre right?  Should I thank them for stopping me from pursuing my dreams with more confidence?

4122,"I've been struggling with imposter syndrome my whole life, I am not sure how I got through my Bachelors and Masters studies in engineering, I have 5 years of work experience in research and development and two months ago I defended my doctoral thesis. Right after this doctoral exam I got some very uplifting feedback from one of the professors saying that I impressed him with being able to answer all of his questions - and it felt like for the first time in my life, I had overcome my imposter syndrome. But, I had a job interview yesterday at my dream workplace and I've been crying for hours since. The head of r&d was there together with two section managers, one of them had interviewed me three months ago and initiated this second interview. He warned me on the phone that the head of r&d was going to put me under a lot of pressure with his questions to test me, and that I should not be intimidated by it. During the interview, he asked me so many questions within my field of research, and I just couldn't answer them, because I am embarassingly bad at remembering formulas. I regularly look them up because I simply can't remember even the basic stuff. Stuff like, what is mechanical power? And he could find all my weak spots and was so arrogant, sadistic even, and now I am questioning myself, how did I even end up getting a doctorate in engineering? And the other two interviewing me were so nice, they never would have tested me this way but now they heard how I can't answer high school level physics questions. I am not sure how I can confidently resume my work in engineering without feeling like everyone knows I'm a fraud. I worked so hard but always felt like trying to hide that I actually only know just enough to not get exposed.

I feel stupid even though I'm predicted mostly As and A*s. Just typing that statement makes me feel stupid, as I think that my good grades should prove to me that im not stupid, so I shouldn't be suffering from imposter syndrome.
Also, I study by doing past papers, so I have to mark them myself. However, there are two problems with this. I usually have to stop marking half way through the paper because I'm too scared of what the end score will be that I feel like I can't keep marking to find out. I know that I might get a good score but I'm too scared of getting a bad score so I can't keep marking it.
Another problem is that if an answer is incorrect, sometimes I have to mark it correct just to keep a good score, even though getting that question wrong doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to get a bad score overall. This makes me feel bad because I'm lying, yet I can't seem to stop doing these things.

4137,"Not sure if this fits in this subreddit, but here we go lol. Short version: I am lazy by nature. However, in February I decided to start working 2 jobs and pay down a bunch of my student loan debt. I also got a job I really enjoy and may have finally found my career path. Because I'm currently so active, every new person I meet thinks I'm some sort of go-getter. 

Long version: I consider myself quite a lazy person because outside of work and exercising a bit, I mainly spend my time playing video games. I'm very introverted, so I don't go out much and meet new people very often, but I have been on a couple of online dating apps, which is where this fa√ßade started. I bring up working 2 jobs and I even take a course my current company is paying for, and everyone is really impressed not even on just the apps, but at work too. 

Without going too much into detail, I graduated university about 6 years ago, and for 5 years, I was in a very deep cycle of depression. I moved in with my mother after a big lay off and I was only paying on the interest of a few private student loans, not even making a dent in the principle balance. Late last year though, I decided enough would be enough, and earlier this year I started working a 2nd job and am able to use the money for my student loans. I got a new main job in January and the company is paying for a course for me to take to advance my career, so I'm also taking that. So yes, it seems like I'm active, and in fact I am no longer depressed at all, but I'm only active now to make up for the last 5 years of being a lazy bastard. And honestly, I'm probably going to go back to being lazy once all of my debt is done with and my course is over. 

So yeah, I just feel like a lazy slob at heart, but everyone thinks I'm this go-getter because of all this stuff I'm doing temporarily.",sure fit subreddit go lol Short version lazy nature However February decided start working 2 job pay bunch student loan debt also got job really enjoy may finally found career path Im currently active every new person meet think Im sort gogetter Long version consider quite lazy person outside work exercising bit mainly spend time playing video game Im introverted dont go much meet new people often couple online dating apps fa√ßade started bring working 2 job even take course current company paying everyone really impressed even apps work Without going much detail graduated university 6 year ago 5 year deep cycle depression moved mother big lay paying interest private student loan even making dent principle balance Late last year though decided enough would enough earlier year started working 2nd job able use money student loan got new main job January company paying course take advance career Im also taking yes seems like Im active fact longer depressed Im active make last 5 year lazy bastard honestly Im probably going go back lazy debt done course yeah feel like lazy slob heart everyone think Im gogetter stuff Im temporarily,anticipation

4140,"Hello I.S. Community.  I (39m) really starting to come to grips with how serious my impostor syndrome is because of an upcoming milestone.  I earned my bachelors in December of last year, and my graduation ceremony is upcoming.  The work is already done (that part anyway, I‚Äôm in grad school) and yet the actual ceremony is making me feel more and more anxious by the day.  Every possible reason why someone could tear down this accomplishment is being spoken to me, in my own voice.

‚ÄúYou went back to a joke school, anyone could get a degree from there.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saddled your wife and therefor your daughter with your student debt and won‚Äôt make enough because of it to make that ok‚Äù

‚ÄúYour almost 40 and had no traumatic life story why are you just getting this now??‚Äù

It‚Äôs the answer to the last one that makes me realize I‚Äôve always had a habit of almost willful mistakes whenever I‚Äôve had the chance to shine in my life, lest people see I‚Äôm a screw up from the first.  When I was in college 20 years ago right out of high school, I became so anxious and convinced I was going to flunk out and disappoint everyone, that I stopped going to class.  Yeah, I still flunked out and disappointed everyone, but at least it was on my own terms.  This way they wouldn‚Äôt know I just couldn‚Äôt hack it academically, even though I‚Äôve never done worse than average, and often times done better, academically when i just did the work. I can now see every potential to shine in my life I have self sabotaged, and the few times that hasn‚Äôt worked, it‚Äôs because those around me wouldn‚Äôt let me fail. I became a workaholic inattentive fianc√© before my wedding, for example) but my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me implode us.  Just one of several dozen more examples.

Now, with this ceremony just a few weeks away, I keep expecting some voice of reason to scream ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù and snap everyone around me out of it.

It's my NINTH day, so of course I don't have it all down pat, and it showed. But guess what? They were still pleased. And then they moved on.

My little voice cropped up saying, ""You idiot - see? Now they all know you're a phony."" But I stopped myself and quickly rewrote the narrative - I was asked to do something on the spot I hadn't been prepped for, given the option to not do it, chose to do it for a logical reason, and didn't do it as smoothly as I will once I get my legs under me - yet I STILL met expectations. Because I'm good at what I do.

I didn't ""fumble"" because ""I'm an inherent failure."" I experienced a very normal situation and nobody batted an eye.

I'm so scared I'm going to mess up production or that I'm not going to have enough ideas for my boss's liking. Essentially they want me to come in and improve little things like worker safety measures and production output. I have my Master's in industrial engineering but I have no clue how to put any of my textbooks to use. Feeling so confused on what to do, and I shouldn't be at all. 

I have to do research on a type of manufacturing process for this as well, because my boss is trusting me to understand how it works. I've just been at home playing Minecraft instead. It's like I *want* to show up unprepared, and the more I think about doing the research, the less I'm able to get done and the more angry I am with myself.

4147,"Something shifted in my job recently. It didn't come with a title change, or a promotion, it just sort of happened. Suddenly I'm supposed to be making policies, procedures, and ""roll outs"". I've never done that in my life. I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing. I don't even know where to start. My manager looks at me like I'm a moron and says ""all you have to do is pick a date and determine exactly how we're going to do this"". Is that supposed to be simple? It doesn't sound simple. Was there some sort of class on this that I missed? 

I get told to look after my mental health and prioritize my work. However, when I tried doing that I was very publicly chewed out over something that, in my mind, is such a low priority item that it doesn't make sense to stress about it. Every time I make those sorts of calls, I get ripped a new asshole. Honestly I feel like some fucked up weirdo because I don't think the same, or communicate the same way as the rest of them. 

Often times what I say is misunderstood even though I think I'm being perfectly clear. I'm ridiculously insecure about how I speak and write because people don't seem to understand me. It's gotten to the point where I sometimes have other people (outside of work) read over what I'm going to say because I'm not confident that I can express myself in a way that my coworkers will understand. It's not an actual language barrier. We're all native English speakers, but sometimes it really doesn't feel that way.

4158,"   For context, there used to be a house directly across the street from my workplace (I work at a gas station) and an old man lived there with his sister. He would regularly come to the store and help out with a couple minor chores like taking out some trash because he really enjoyed helping out, and I think he needed things to occupy his time. We all gave him as much free food and drinks as he wanted, basically. He is a very sweet old man.

  My store is on a street corner and his house was on the street corner right across from us. It's a really shitty intersection where people often run red lights or cut through our parking lot going way too fast. The old man had a fruit stand as the front portion of his house where a porch would be and that had been hit by cars a few times over the years. But one night a few months ago, a dude crashed directly into the house, through the old man's bedroom (which thankfully he wasn't in) and part way into the living room, (which he was in) and shattered the main support beam for the house.

  I was inside at the time and my coworker and I heard a loud crash so we went outside to see what happened and when we saw the truck, she started freaking out and I rushed over to see if the old man was ok. I dug through the rubble trying to get to the old man passed the truck and ended up unburying the driver's door but couldn't get farther than that, so I checked if the dude was hurt at all, he said his shoulder hurt a lot and he was bleeding but he was conscious and seemed in pain but mostly ok, so I left him there for paramedics to look at when they arrived. Them I went around the other side of the truck to find a way through. I heard the old man calling out and I broke through a door I probably shouldn't have because the house wasn't exactly stable. And I started calling his name so I could find where he was. He wasn't buried under a whole lot of debris, just a couple walls worth of stuff but he was completely hidden from view and I had to use his voice to find exactly where he was to uncover him and pull him out.

  Later that night, my coworker called me a hero, and the next day another coworker did the same thing. The next day also, a reporter was going to be interviewing the old man and wanted to know who got him out (I assume to interview them as well) and he tried to point me out but I shook my head at them and said it wasn't me and turned and walked away. All of that made me extremely uncomfortable, especially people calling me a hero to my face. And it wasn't just a feeling of modesty, like oh I was just doing what anyone would do. I would call that a positive emotion. Like thank you that is nice of you but I'm not a hero. This was more like an aversion to being called that. It was a negative emotion, like absolutely don't call me that, I don't deserve to be called that. 

  I haven't told anyone at all about this before now, other than my wife. A few people from my store (coworkers and regular customers) know because some were there and people talk and it's a rural community, but I didn't tell any of them.

4162,"I am a person with pretty serious anxiety, depression, ADHD and imposter syndrome of some sort. Usually my symptoms/behavior are pretty manageable. But lately the ""imposter narrative"" has been taking over, especially during Covid where I have to stay inside with my fiancee for long periods. Basically I've discovered a lot of my worldview consists of a few very persistent, aggressive delusions:

* Anyone who claims they like me is lying; I don't know why, but I am 100% certain they are doing so.
* Anyone who claims to love me is merely tolerating me, and saying they love me just because I am convenient for them and their purposes in the moment.

4175,"So, my life's been a mess since I was a little kid. Abuse, bullying, self harm, drugs, institutions... But now I'm clean. Hasn't been a straight path but I'm doing better. I started going to school again to be able to move on to university studies later on. 

Being in school is... Weird. I'm no longer bullied, quite the opposite. People seem to admire me. They keep telling me I'm intelligent, seem confident and competent. One of my classmates once told me ""in class you're superior to everyone else but talking to you feels like talking to a normal person"". One of my teachers claims I'm one of the most gifted people she's ever taught during her 27 years as a teacher... And it all makes me want to cry. And not out of gratitude or happiness, but because it all feels fake. They tested me for autism when I was little and I found out my IQ was at 142. I've always used that as a comfort when I feel like I don't belong - ""the others may be worthwhile and lovable but at least I'm smarter"". But when others are kind and including I don't even trust my intellectual abilities. A huge part of me believes the drugs ruined it. I feel as if people are just saying these things cause they feel bad for me, just like I often feel as if my friends hang out with me for that reason. It's painful... And hard to talk about with other people since it would sound like I'm just looking for attention, or boosting about the compliments I'm getting.

I've been fighting my ED and other kinds of perfectionism lately. I want to change, I want to believe I'm good enough, but I don't know how... I feel as if I'm alone in this, even though I realize that I'm not on a logical level. I guess I just needed to get this out there.

4188,"To give details but not too specifically, I attend an elite university on the East Coast. I gained a full-scholarship there and gained a full-scholarship in high school too. Although, I have grown to be OK with rich people, in high school, I deeply resented almost all of my classmates as I felt that it was unjust the circumstances I grew up in (living with family in one bed room apt, subletting,  being food insecure, and even cleaning offices/houses with my mom on weekends). It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter. I had nightmares very very often and would wake up at like 4 or 5 AM to edit group presentations just so i wouldn't let other people down. 

In college, it's a lot better since people can't come over and what not and are somewhat more mature. But, now that I am an upperclassman, I feel an immense pressure to go into IB/Finance. I received some Bulge Bracket firm interviews and even made it to final round, but didn't get the summer internship. I felt like I was a failure to my family and to myself and to the expectations of my colleagues in college. I don't know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel that IB/finance is meant for the rich and that they ovviously have an upper hand while I have to fight to get myself a position. Even stupid jocks get jobs just b/c of alumni connections. It's just discouraging ......

I was able to apply to a job in a very ideal education setting, in a position I never had the chance at acquiring before graduation, and was asked to an interview. I am qualified. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around that. I‚Äôve felt severe anxiety since accepting the interview invitation. Not excitement or aspiration. I have no control over this emotion (or lack thereof). I cannot mentally accept I‚Äôve accomplished this goal. 

My degree was conferred last month, but my *physical* diploma came in the mail today. Rather than feeling excitement, I cried. They weren‚Äôt tears of joy. 

I don‚Äôt believe in myself.

4205,"I think I'm a fairly intelligent person, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists for over 30 years, but somehow until recently I hadn't heard the term ""imposter syndrome"". My entire life I would wait until someone became a really close friend and I would confess to them that I'm racked with these irrational fears of everyone finding out that I'm a fraud and completely unqualified to be who i am and because of these fears I tend to live my life in a cycle of creating perfection in my career, family, home, wardrobe, parenting, etc and then reaching some undefined peak, only to watch myself burn it all the ground. I've rebuilt my entire life so many times that I can't even count anymore. Now I've actually created my own company, surrounded myself in great people that all seem to think I'm some kind of genius, of which I am not, become financially successful (at least to some degree), kids are grown, marriage is stable, mental health is under control, and I've actually stuck with my current career for 10+ years. My work actually brings me joy. It also brings stress, bc it's work, but there is joy. But I'm also finding out that these feelings and fears I have are an actual thing with a name. At first that made me feel validated. I'm so glad that this sub exists and that the people here seem nice and supportive of each other. It's reassuring. It's also terrifying to know for sure that this isn't all in my head and I may be doomed to repeat this destructive cycle forever. I'm getting older. I can't keep destroying everything and rebuilding. I'm getting too old for it. Everyone understood when I was 20, a new parent, still finding myself. I know the fears are still there. I'm still terrified that I'm a complete fraud. I know that someday, any day now, people will realize that I never knew anything or even knew what I was doing as I trained others. Then those other people that I trained will have to explain themselves too. I know it's irrational, but I also know all too well how this story ends. I've been here many times before. Idk.

I was in a really competitive high school a few years back, and actually managed to get great grades but was seen as the ‚Äúsmart kid‚Äù and my friends and teachers judged me a lot if I wasn‚Äôt getting into a prestigious program or school or if I did less well on tests which we had every week, and my mental health was really bad as a result. A lot of my friends had really toxic or abusive relationships (platonic romantic familial) and always leveraged off success as their defining ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing better‚Äù kind of moment, and it compelled me to do the same even though it was destroying me. Fast forward and I‚Äôve graduated a long time ago and no longer talk to anyone there. 

I‚Äôve noticed that my imposter syndrome has gotten so bad and ironically manifests in little white lies. For example, I‚Äôve been telling people that I got into X university when they ask but decided not to go; but the truth is I didn‚Äôt even apply there. I hate how easily little lies like this slip out of my mouth even when meeting new people when they ask, and I really want to stop even though these lies have no effect on serious aspects of my life :( yesterday I met someone new and this slipped out yet again, and it just bothers me so much.

4219,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you‚Äôre succeeding, even if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the skills,‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You‚Äôre succeeding. It‚Äôs the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that‚Äôs who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It‚Äôs hard to tell internally whether you‚Äôre funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You‚Äôre not a good judge of that. You‚Äôre on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people‚Äôs actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it‚Äôs so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn‚Äôt be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There‚Äôs no downside. Even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it or supposedly don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you‚Äôll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don‚Äôt know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I‚Äôll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I‚Äôve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I‚Äôve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there‚Äôs a more tangible motivator- ‚ÄòI really want to have a good day, and it‚Äôs statistically much more likely if I‚Äôm productive.‚Äô Try it if you‚Äôd like. Idk. I didn‚Äôt keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain‚Äôt real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it‚Äôs happening, that‚Äôs a fantastic help. It‚Äôs even better when/if you‚Äôre able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I‚Äôm rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you‚Äôll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful.  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£

I would like to thank anyone who is reading this for taking the time out of your lives to read a stranger's thoughts. I am starting high school soon, and I understand that I am at the age where problems like these are common. I am trying to find an outward perspective from others. I have hesitated to share my thoughts here for fear of being insensitive to others that need more assistance. I appologize in advance if I offend anyone, know that I didnt have malicious intentions. A disclaimer that the first paragraph may sound a little arrogant.

With that all being said, I feel that I dont deserve my life. I have grown up in a fortunate area where many students are highly academic. Personally, others see me in a pretty good light as someone who is a model student and I have had some good aconplishments. 

However, as the year goes on, I feel like I dont deserve the life I have, that I didn't work hard ebough for the things I have done. I see others working hard and I feel I am not at the same level. Yet part of me is preventing myself from being motivated to work.

I would appreciate any perspectives. Even critical negitive ones will help me see if my problem is important or not, even though I understand it is something many go through.

Composing music started out fun, Until I learned a bit of music theory and started to hear my creations closer and realized their were all mediocre and not worthy to be listened to, Or at least, That's what I've been telling myself.

Now it's gotten to the point where i'm being suggested to collaborate with another composer, which I can't do because of my Social anxiety. Not to mention I have severe trust issues.

And even If I did get additional help, I might as well not help because they would most likely be 10 times as competent compared to me.

I‚Äôve been a professional musician for 5 years now. In terms of performing, I have worked past my feelings of feeling inadequate. At this point it‚Äôs audio engineering and teaching that are a struggle for me.

As a teacher I‚Äôve been teaching online since 2018. I have nothing but 5 star reviews, but I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough for my students. I went to school for music and think I‚Äôm reasonably well trained, but I have this anxiety that with each student at some point I‚Äôm going to run out of helpful things to tell them and I‚Äôll just be getting paid to sit with them while they practice. I often get nervous during my lessons that students feel I‚Äôm wasting their time, but they come back from week to week. 

As an audio engineer I also started in 2018. I did not have a ton of experience, so I charged a small fee and did the best I could. I did NOT go to school to become an audio engineer, but decided to do it after college. I‚Äôve took an intensive course helping me to feel more confident in my tracking, editing, and mixing abilities, as well as joining an online cohort for 6 months to get feedback on my work. I‚Äôve put in time and I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with some great clients... but I am going to be working with a group signed to Warner Bros. and I just feel like I‚Äôm not worthy. I forced myself to take the opportunity, but I am really nervous about it. I am also working on an album for a vocal band right now and feel like I‚Äôm not doing them justice, despite saying they‚Äôre loving the product thus far. 

I try not to let my feelings of being a fraud interfere with my life and the business I‚Äôve built for myself... and I try to push myself to take opportunities even if I‚Äôm not comfortable with it...  but I know in my heart of hearts that my feelings are affecting my ability to do my best work and have periodically paralyzed me with fear.

4258,"Sometimes it feels like my actions are geared, all of the time, to prove my imposter syndrome right. I applied for a job, genuinely believing I wouldn't receive an invitation to interview. I couldn't sleep the night I applied because I was humiliated at the thought of someone reading my C.V. To my surprise I got a call to interview. Shortly after that call, I told myself that they had already chosen another candidate for the job, and my invitation for interview was only because they had to fulfil a certain quota of interviewees. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well after that either.

Anyway, I performed poorly in my interview today and I didn't get the job. What do you know, my imposter syndrome was right all along. Running narratives like: it was silly of me to apply in the first place, why did I think I would've gotten this anyway, of course they had someone else in mind, I'm not skilled at interviewing so why would I even bother. I remember beforehand sitting in the interview waiting room thinking it's not too late for me to run away, cancel the interview, save the shame. 

What is this (imposter syndrome) about? Is it a perverse sense of self-preservation? Never fully committing to believing in myself, because the fall from grace would be too great? Feeling like I have to run harmful stories about myself, so that I can 'get in' before any threat enters? It doesn't work though. I still feel a bit upset despite 'expecting failure' - maybe because I realise that the way I treat myself is unfair, and ultimately doesn't get me anywhere.

Still, things I'm proud of (because fuck you imposter syndrome):

* I proved I can get to interview stage, gap in C.V. be damned 
* I can get through an interview, maybe not \*successfully\*. But the world didn't end. I'm alive. I'm here. The embarrassment of trying (& trying & failing & trying) won't kill me.

4263,"I‚Äôll try to make this quick. I‚Äôm a 20 year old birth doula. If you don‚Äôt know what that means, it‚Äôs a female-only non-medical support career for women giving birth. I‚Äôm trained in physical comfort measures, methods such as hypnobirthing, mediation/emotional support, and advocacy for my clients‚Äô decisions about their labor and birth.

This is a field that has just recently started to grow in popularity, and despite how simple it may sound, certification is a long, hard process. I‚Äôm extremely passionate about the importance of birth and how the idea of it has been corrupted to seem like a medical emergency in every scenario, and modern hospitals routinely abuse mothers in labor. My desire to change this has kept me going for 2 years. I‚Äôm completely trained, yet still uncertified due to the last steps being hands-on experience among other things. The pandemic has kept doulas out of hospitals, making it extremely difficult to find clients for my 3 certifying births, especially as a brand new doula. 

Recently, I‚Äôve taken some steps that have finally led 3 clients to contact me. I‚Äôm aware that all three are mostly interested in my low fee, which is less than a third of what experienced and certified doulas charge. Regardless, I need these 3 births to get certified and begin growing my practice. 

Working with a doula client involves both gathering all information about their pregnancy, birth history, desires for their birth plan, and health information, as well as educating the client on certain decisions, comfort measures, procedures, and birth physiology. There are generally two prenatal meetings preceding the birth and one postpartum meeting afterwords. I‚Äôve held two meetings for different clients. 

It‚Äôs overwhelming having little guidance while jumping into such a large career. No one tells you how to run a prenatal meeting. Your textbook knowledge has to be accurate and unbiased. You have to be intuitive to a laboring woman‚Äôs needs when she can‚Äôt express them verbally. You need to be an expert at active listening and mediation without any personal input or advice.   You need to have thick skin and be open to rejection and criticism from doctors, nurses, clients, other doulas, midwives, and close-minded people who believe there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright‚Äù way to give birth. 

With the lack of support, training, and insight, I slaved over creating an itinerary with minuscule help from Google and a few of my birth books before I ran my first meeting. This is where it gets tough. I know the meeting went well, but I still went home and cried. No matter how much I prepare or how well I know I‚Äôve done, I can‚Äôt make myself believe I actually belong here. After my second meeting, I was 100% convinced that the couple wanted nothing to do with me. That they‚Äôd opted out of wanting a doula after all and they would just ghost me. Of course, this was not the case but it seemed so real in my head. 

At one point, I made an Instagram post about the importance of skin to skin contact directly after birth to meet my ‚Äúone social media post per month‚Äù quota for a local doula group I‚Äôm in. A midwife dm‚Äôd me, disagreeing with a claim I made about newborn discomfort in the birth canal. I‚Äôd read about this fact before and it was even brought up in my initial doula training. I was sure I was correct, yet I was sent into one of the worst spirals of self-hatred of my life. I‚Äôd never felt so incompetent. My thoughts had never been scarier. I was convinced that everyone I had status with had seen the post and disagreed with it and I was now the laughing stalk of the area. I then pinned this idea to the itinerary of an upcoming meeting with my doula group, and I was convinced one of the topics was added because of my post. I emailed the leader of the group (actually it turns out I emailed THE ENTIRE BOARD) with a panicked message about how sorry I was. She had no idea what I was talking about and I completely humiliated myself as a new, inexperienced member.

Just today, I received a text from a client saying she was checking into an appointment with her midwife that I had agreed to attend. I‚Äôd forgotten to put it on my calendar, and I was currently tied up with one of my 3 other jobs, which was nannying my infant nieces. I had to explain the situation and apologize profusely and I could tell she wasn‚Äôt impressed. I‚Äôve been thrown between beating myself up and distracting myself all day.

Somehow, every time I move forward, I feel like absolute shit. Every time I make a mistake I feel like absolute shit. Every single thing I do makes me want to give it all up because I can never ever be good enough. People tell me I‚Äôm born for this field and it‚Äôs my calling. This is genuinely my dream career and I want to believe them. Everyone says that every doula is important because we all offer different skills and personality traits. I want to know I‚Äôm not just the one exception to that. I‚Äôm working my ass off and pouring so much time and money into getting my life started, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm good enough. I hate this feeling so much. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and confidently learn from my mistakes, but both just make me hate myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been in therapy and I‚Äôve done all the natural mental health support I can do and nothings changing. I‚Äôm terrified for when I actually support my first birth (I‚Äôve attended two as a shadow to an experienced doula but never been the primary.) I‚Äôm worried the self-doubt is the only thing holding me back and it‚Äôs eventually going to tear me down.

4264,"I (28F) grew up in extreme poverty. Like eating chocolate cake all month or PowerBars because it's what was what we had in our monthly food boxes. 
When I was 18 I got a job as a caregiver for a family member, had a child at 21 and when my family member passed when I was 22 I was out of work for a year. I dropped out of school and never got my GED so I wasn't able to get a job no matter where I applied. 

Eventually, things got so bad I went to DHS for help getting my life on track and they paid for me to get my GED and go to college for medical assisting. Somehow I passed with a 4.0 GPA and got the idea that I'd continue school to become a nurse instead. 3 years, a 3.89 GPA, 108 credits, and an associate in general studies later I finally got into nursing!

I somehow did it all by studying maybe 4 hours a week, if I write what I'm studying with pencil and paper in my own words/understanding, I pretty much have the subject memorized and get between 85% - 99% on my tests.

The problem is that I'm not like everyone else, they have successful parents, and nobody has ever even played a video game or watched anime before. I try to talk about my likes and I get a dead eyed stare from a room of people that I have nothing in common with.

4266,"So my understanding of imposter syndrome is pretty limited but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve developed it.

Throughout most of my academic career, school and uni, I‚Äôve done good.

4272,"In finite games (or games where there is a goal, a winner and a loser, and set boundaries), the prize is a title (whether that is being a gold medalist, getting a promotion, or being a degree holder). This is in contrast of infinite games, where there are no winners, and the point of the game is to keep the game going (for example, the game of literature, the game of science, and the game of music). 

Imposter Syndrome typically occurs to me, and maybe some of you, in school or at work (both in which are finite games). The titles that we earn in finite games are titles symbolizing the accomplishments of the past. Having a Harvard degree symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Becoming a director symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. Getting a gold medal symbolizes that we did well enough in the past. These titles are not about the present, but the past! These titles are a form of credit that tells the world that we did well in the past; the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Possibly, anxiety from Imposter Syndrome comes from having the titles but being unsure about our capacity to hold up to the expectations of these titles.

How does one hold up to the expectations of these titles? One possibility is to do well enough... in which you later get another title. And then the cycle repeats itself. You can have your high school degree, your bachelors, your masters, and you can be part of the C-suite, and still have Imposter Syndrome. 

My proposed solution, and I know it's easier said than done, is to let go of the expectations and trust that we've been appropriately given the title. There is no way that *all* these people, institutions, and systems were wrong. Since part of the anxiety is not meeting expectations, another thing that can be done is focusing on the present and do the best we can - the chances are that we can meet expectations. After all, it's a game and we've been beating level after level - we're literally where we are supposed to be.",finite game game goal winner loser set boundary prize title whether gold medalist getting promotion degree holder contrast infinite game winner point game keep game going example game literature game science game music Imposter Syndrome typically occurs maybe school work finite game title earn finite game title symbolizing accomplishment past Harvard degree symbolizes well enough past Becoming director symbolizes well enough past Getting gold medal symbolizes well enough past title present past title form credit tell world well past best predictor future behavior past behavior Possibly anxiety Imposter Syndrome come title unsure capacity hold expectation title one hold expectation title One possibility well enough later get another title cycle repeat high school degree bachelor master part Csuite still Imposter Syndrome proposed solution know easier said done let go expectation trust weve appropriately given title way people institution system wrong Since part anxiety meeting expectation another thing done focusing present best chance meet expectation game weve beating level level literally supposed,trust
4275,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

4280,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you‚Äôre succeeding, even if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the skills,‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You‚Äôre succeeding. It‚Äôs the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that‚Äôs who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It‚Äôs hard to tell internally whether you‚Äôre funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You‚Äôre not a good judge of that. You‚Äôre on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people‚Äôs actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it‚Äôs so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn‚Äôt be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There‚Äôs no downside. Even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it or supposedly don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you‚Äôll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don‚Äôt know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I‚Äôll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I‚Äôve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I‚Äôve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there‚Äôs a more tangible motivator- ‚ÄòI really want to have a good day, and it‚Äôs statistically much more likely if I‚Äôm productive.‚Äô Try it if you‚Äôd like. Idk. I didn‚Äôt keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain‚Äôt real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it‚Äôs happening, that‚Äôs a fantastic help. It‚Äôs even better when/if you‚Äôre able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I‚Äôm rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you‚Äôll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful.  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£

4282,"I hear a lot about Imposter Syndrome in the terms of careers and the workplace but less socially which is something I'm facing. 

I've somehow managed to build this reputation of being a confident, self-assured, sociable guy but inside I feel like I'm really not. Those qualities listed above are what I believe to be the way that people perceive me (based on what they've said and that I've heard) but I don't consider myself any of those things. 

They all assume I'm extroverted and confident, the topic has come up before, but I get socially anxious about speaking up, I stutter a lot, my mind blanks while I speak, I dwell over interactions way after they're done. But somehow, on the outside that doesn't come across. So I start getting treated as a person that I really am not. At times it can make me very uncomfortable and I'm subjected to expectations that I am not able to meet. 

Now, the thing is, I like being perceived this way. It's nice that people think you're self-assured and confident but am I just being a faker? Am I supposed to be true to who I really am or continue a charade.

4299,"idk if this is the place for this.   like trying to get into a new thing, a new franchise.  actually, pretty much anything ive been a part of i often feel like im not a 'true fan'.   so for example, something old that i liked since i was a kid was pokemon.  i started out with the first games, RBY.    i dont really feel like an imposter for liking pokemon, but sometimes i still do.  but even moreso is something like street figther.  i never played traditional fighting games until a few years ago, with Street Fighter V.   i really want to like it, but i feel like such idk, an outsider? a fake? both.   i wasnt a part of the community that followed the games from the originals.   i like the storyline, the lore, but since i wasnt a part of it from the beginning, i feel detached from it somehow.  like its not a part of me and never will be.  whereas pokemon, its practically part of my identity (maybe thats a bad thing too, basing myself off of external things, trying to see myself in characters and not seeing the characters as separate entities from myself, but i have always struggled with knowing myself in general).     


but its just especially prevalent with new things. i cant get into things easily.  i constantly think about the people who know more, have been around longer, are better at the videogames, what have you.   makes me feel like trying to find ""my"" thing, but i dont have a thing.   ""jack of all trades, master of none, better than a master of one"", but that doesnt feel true. i wish i was really good at one thing.  i feel im straying from my original issue, but well, its that i cant commit to anything.  my passions are flimsy, i never feel completely immersed in anything--instrument, music, movies, drawing, videogames, skilltoys; i do all these different things but i never completely can give myself permission to just enjoy something fully.  i always feel sortof detached no matter what i do--and that also prevents me from really excelling at anything, i think.     


but it also feels like a depression thing.  it feels sorta cyclical; cant get immersed-->dont feel enjoyment-->cant get immersed.  which came first, idk, but the result is me being more or less numb.    and t his extends to so much beyond just liking things. its like part of who and how i am.   like afraid to be real.  so afraid that i forget how to stop being afraid, and when i start to mellow out, i get anxious becuse suddenly there's a weight to everything.  to social interactions. to the real world.  and then i go numb again, because its safer to have this hyper-aware, low level anxiety combined with a detachment from personal feelings, than to actually feel.   but feeling is what makes life worth living, obviously.   gotta take the good with the bad, or neither and end up with nothing.  but the bad psyches me out to the point of giving up on anything i started to be passionate about--thus cyclical.  its like my choices are: feel too much, or feel nothing.  yeah this is definitely beyond just imposter syndrome, but it also feels like it isnt. like its a part of imposter syndrome. ",idk place like trying get new thing new franchise actually pretty much anything ive part often feel like im true fan example something old liked since kid pokemon started first game RBY dont really feel like imposter liking pokemon sometimes still even moreso something like street figther never played traditional fighting game year ago Street Fighter V really want like feel like idk outsider fake wasnt part community followed game original like storyline lore since wasnt part beginning feel detached somehow like part never whereas pokemon practically part identity maybe thats bad thing basing external thing trying see character seeing character separate entity always struggled knowing general especially prevalent new thing cant get thing easily constantly think people know around longer better videogames make feel like trying find thing dont thing jack trade master none better master one doesnt feel true wish really good one thing feel im straying original issue well cant commit anything passion flimsy never feel completely immersed anythinginstrument music movie drawing videogames skilltoys different thing never completely give permission enjoy something fully always feel sortof detached matter doand also prevents really excelling anything think also feel like depression thing feel sorta cyclical cant get immerseddont feel enjoymentcant get immersed came first idk result le numb extends much beyond liking thing like part like afraid real afraid forget stop afraid start mellow get anxious becuse suddenly there weight everything social interaction real world go numb safer hyperaware low level anxiety combined detachment personal feeling actually feel feeling make life worth living obviously got ta take good bad neither end nothing bad psyche point giving anything started passionate aboutthus cyclical like choice feel much feel nothing yeah definitely beyond imposter syndrome also feel like isnt like part imposter syndrome,trust

4311,"Wow, I can recall details of my success, but I also don‚Äôt believe it?! I can recall getting 99% in my college course and how proud I was as a young person. I was fresh out of high school, confident, and ready for challenges that came. I took some courses and found out I was pregnant with my ‚Äúhigh school sweetheart.‚Äù That put college on pause. Fast forward, after he had cheated on me again we ended up getting divorced, two kids deep. I started dating this guy I considered safe because safety emotionally was my main concern after being cheated on terribly. This man wasn‚Äôt safe. I remember him saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised your waist is that skinny.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour ankles are kind of fat.‚Äù It was like a load of bricks hit me. Why say that? Why point that out? He was no supermodel and of course I wasn‚Äôt scrutinizing his appearance. I just wanted a loving relationship. Fast fast forward. The scrutiny turned into much more. Making fun of me in front of his friends for laughs, hitting in my friends, being angry at me for not indulging him in a threesome, saying it was unfair and that I was effecting his life in an unfair way by withholding. Telling my I was stupid. I was back in college. I graduated with honors and kids in tow. Everything I did I now found myself checking three times to be sure.  Because now I‚Äôm convinced to a T that I am no good. I was nominated for two awards by my instructors. Still I think, ‚Äúwhy would they pick me, how did I fool them?‚Äù I ended up leaving him and it was very hard to do. I likened the way I felt to a flayed person with no skin, no protection, just pure vulnerability.
It‚Äôs been about 2 years since I left. I got a glowing review from my boss at work. I again felt like he was wrong, that he doesn‚Äôt really see how stupid I am.

4314,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don‚Äôt know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I‚Äôm so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my ‚Äúthing‚Äù, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can‚Äôt you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your ‚Äúthing‚Äù?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I‚Äôm not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I‚Äôm saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can‚Äôt I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I‚Äôm a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking.

4320,"Hi All,

Let me start by saying I believe I've had imposter syndrome for as long as I can remember (going back to elementary school and believing I was not at the same level as my school peers).

&#x200B;

I have since graduated college with a fairly high GPA and honors -- but I still can't shake the feeling that I am not ready for an ""adult"" job. I've been working on my resume (obsessing mostly), trying to perfect it, sell myself as best I can without over-selling. My father says I need to just start applying but I am just so anxious that any job I get with some responsibility, I'll end up failing.

&#x200B;

I do suffer from anxiety and OCD, so I'm basically always already doubting myself. The thing is, through experience, I tend to overthink situations. I have for as long as I can remember. But in the end, things that I've overthought tend to not be as scary as I've made them in my mind.

&#x200B;

I feel like with my current job hunting situation, this is no different -- but I still can't get out of my own head! Can anyone relate? Do you have any tips to share for me to overcome this current feeling of inadequacy?

4322,"Hello, first post here I'm wondering if this belongs? 

Going back I had a rough childhood and have always felt like I haven't really been doing anything to get where I was. A lot of my youth I've felt like I didn't really do anything or belong where I was but I have worked on moving past that. 

However, when I was just barely an adult at 18, I started my journey to where I am now and I feel to this day that I am faking it and don't belong where I am. 

I started to work at a chain coffee shop, and ended up dating one of my coworkers. While we were dating he ended up quitting and started to work doing food trucks and some other odds and ends, he was able to get me some shifts with him while he was working these jobs. We did brake up but were on good terms, we stood friends and I continued to help him out. I had already met his family, and was still on really good terms with them as well. 

Here is where it all went in a different direction and completely changed my life. I don't want to give to many details for privacy reasons, but basically his Grandma was working as a contractor for a client that needed a full time accountant. Her daughter also worked at this client but as a full time employee. Between the two of them they were running basically all the financial aspects. They were swamped and needed help. 

I'm fresh out of high school, working through my first semester of college and they reach out to me. I guess GM had started accounting really young with her dad, and taught her daughter (now M) the same when she was around 15 ish. GM knew that this client wanted someone with experience in to help, but they didn't want to pay for said experience. GM has also had bad experiences with college grads who thought they knew everything and didn't listen to her directions. 

So GM and M interviewed me and basically said, look we saw your work with EXBF and know that you are a hard worker, and we have an opportunity for you. All I had to do was pretend I did have some experience from highschool etc, and they would teach me everything I needed to know. 

True to their word GM and M were amazing and taught me almost everything they know. They were amazing humans and helped me out and treated me like family the entire time. Unfortunately, the client wasn't the best, and we all left. GM actually vouched for me going back through Highschool, and with what she taught me I have now worked 2 different positions in accounting. 

On paper, I have experience and in real life, I have that same experience give or take a year or so before I was 18. I've been in this field for years now, and have found a lot of people in this field haven't gone to school, but have the life experience. 

The thing is, going back to when they first extended the offer, long before I even had the opportunity for this, I felt wrong. Off. Like I was lying about who I was. This amazing family accepting me in didn't feel right. I have no reason for this. I'm forever grateful for them, and am still in contact with them. But I am haunted that I somehow lied or cheated my way to where I am in in life now. 

I just got accepted for my first lease, my boyfriend and I got the keys last week. I'm paying off a car I was able to buy that feels way out of range for me. We have two pets and are in a pretty good place I would like to think. But it feels wrong, like I didn't do anything to get here. Like someone is going to figure out that I lied to get here, that I don't know what I'm doing, that I'm a fake and took the jobs I had from people who did work to get there.",Hello first post Im wondering belongs Going back rough childhood always felt like havent really anything get lot youth Ive felt like didnt really anything belong worked moving past However barely adult 18 started journey feel day faking dont belong started work chain coffee shop ended dating one coworkers dating ended quitting started work food truck odds end able get shift working job brake good term stood friend continued help already met family still really good term well went different direction completely changed life dont want give many detail privacy reason basically Grandma working contractor client needed full time accountant daughter also worked client full time employee two running basically financial aspect swamped needed help Im fresh high school working first semester college reach guess GM started accounting really young dad taught daughter around 15 ish GM knew client wanted someone experience help didnt want pay said experience GM also bad experience college grad thought knew everything didnt listen direction GM interviewed basically said look saw work EXBF know hard worker opportunity pretend experience highschool etc would teach everything needed know True word GM amazing taught almost everything know amazing human helped treated like family entire time Unfortunately client wasnt best left GM actually vouched going back Highschool taught worked 2 different position accounting paper experience real life experience give take year 18 Ive field year found lot people field havent gone school life experience thing going back first extended offer long even opportunity felt wrong Like lying amazing family accepting didnt feel right reason Im forever grateful still contact haunted somehow lied cheated way life got accepted first lease boyfriend got key last week Im paying car able buy feel way range two pet pretty good place would like think feel wrong like didnt anything get Like someone going figure lied get dont know Im Im fake took job people work get,trust

4331,"I guess I just need to get this out and see if this mirrors anyone else's experience.

Or if I'm just completely out of my mind.

My therapist definitely believes I have impostor syndrome. This is based on some information I explained to him. In my classes (senior in college), for example, I received an A on both term papers for both courses last term, a 97% and a 98%. And I am still waiting for the grade to be lowered because SURELY these professionals have to figure out that it's all fraudulent. The school I go to uses turn it in and I am able to see my results, both had low %s meaning the content was original, yet I'm still convinced somehow I must've cheated on the assignments. Logically, I know I did not, I remember the painstaking and grueling hours reading the research, putting them together and writing it out in the APA format. I also did well on the quizzes. I can't fathom that I have gotten those grades on my own but I know, logically, I did.

I am also a community activist locally. I don't do anything major or impressive--but it requires me to confront politicians and community leaders with a ton of stats and facts. I am known for my skills in researching and strategy on these topics. I am by no means a mastermind. But I am often able to cite case studies and statistics --yet, even though I've done the hours of research, written them down into an essay, presented them and even have had them double checked, I constantly have to re-check the information before speaking on them again, as I am convinced I have them wrong or made them up. 

This all sounds like impostor syndrome to me--but the part that I never hear about it and I wonder if anyone else deals with this or if its a totally different ""syndrome"". I don't just expect to exposed as a fraud, I expect to be exposed as a horrible human being. I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, most of which I've at least made an effort to atone for, but I am constantly waiting for my ""horrid actions"" to bd exposed--and often times, they are imagined actions or they are based on real events but ""modified"".

One example and I know this sounds strange: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up 3 years ago (almost). And it was a nasty fight, I was crude and petty. The relationship NEEDED to end. I regret how I ended it. But we made amends for both of our wrongdoings throughout the relationship and while we've maintained a healthy emotional distance since then, when we see each other (pre-COVID) we say hi, we've had some small social media interactions and we've even discussed the end of our relationship. In fact, we respect each other very much and the relationship. Yet, nonsensically, I've ""imagined"" him ""exposing"" me as this horrid person who destroyed his life. I know that's not going to happen and it's not true--but it has become to the point that I actually thought I was going to lose all my friends and my standing in my community over it. But there's no actual basis for this. 

I also am frequently expecting the law to come to me and ""catch me"" for the horrible crimes I've committed. I fear being caught, but not for anything I've done, but rather, that I'll be ""planted"" and charged. Now, I am a community activist but not high level enough to worry about that happening.

All of this is based on non-sense. And I have not been diagnosed with anything like psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't have auditory or visual hallucinations. But I am constantly surrounded by guilt and feelings of inadequacy, which I believe is beyond the average persons standard of self-doubt and insecurity.

Thank you for letting me share and I know I sound ""crazy"". If you have any advice or resources, or similar stories (even if you would prefer to share them in a private message), I'm here to listen.

I've talked about this to my wife and with my boss (a little). They both tell me to, essentially, lighten up and that I'm qualified. Technically, I am qualified, but I feel like such an outsider. I don't belong here. 

I guess I don't even have a question. I just want to know that others feel this way. I want some affirmation that I'm not just wasting everyone's time including my own.

4337,"**EDIT:  I cross-posted this to** r/askpsychology **, and am much calmer than I was when I first posted.  I have settled into a tired, calm numbness, but I don't think that it is a bad thing, given the circumstances.** 

&#x200B;

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female.  I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work.  Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon.  My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack.  For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

&#x200B;

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud.  As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear.  I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome.  I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too.  Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it.  I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

&#x200B;

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten.  I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after.  I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter.  I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME.  I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me.  ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ <--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it.  I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

&#x200B;

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself.  But I am definitely in crisis.  The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline.  The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it.  I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me.  I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me.  That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

&#x200B;

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work.  I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth.  I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents).  I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is.  He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere.  I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me.  So I try to make him as happy as possible.  He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

&#x200B;

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life.  And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have.  In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can.  I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON.  Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine.  But I lie.  My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason.  I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day.  I ignore them.  One of these bills is for $8.  Eight fucking dollars.  I'm paralyzed about it.  I won't fix it.  These are only a few aspects of my life as examples.  I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships.  I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having.  I lie about having other plans.  I deserve to have my life fucked up.  I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway.  At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it...  It feels like my whole world is upside down.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, thank you.  I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this.  The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

&#x200B;

This is the first day of my life.  Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where.  I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing.  I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

4339,"Alrighty, little background about me. M20, currently going to uni for Health Studies and I‚Äôm in my third year. This year, most of my classes have in personal components, but the last two were all virtually online. Now my issue here is that, I hardly ever try for my classes and I pump out 90 after 90 and keep getting told that I‚Äôm doing so well and get told that they can see that I put effort into my writing. When in actuality, I put a total of 5 hours of effort, the day before it‚Äôs due. Getting this kind of feedback day in and out and then seeing people who ACTUALLY put in the effort getting 60‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs is crushing my mind with guilt and anxiety. I don‚Äôt even tel anyone my average because I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve it, even saying that I get 90‚Äôs while doing literally doing all the work last minute makes me sick to my stomach. 

For example, on a essay I had to write about a social topic of concern, I choose food scarcity. So did 5 other people. Now, I obviously left it to the last minute, threw some things together and BAM, essay done. Everyone else, took the entire 2 months allotted to this assignment that‚Äôs worth 40% of our overall grade to do it. Grades come back and I was fully expecting a 60% and I would‚Äôve been okay with that. Turns out I got a 97% and everyone else, got a 68% or lower. And when everyone asked me how long did I work on it, I felt so guilty telling them that I worked on it for 8 hours before the deadline and got a 30% higher grade when they spent over a month researching and writing and editing. I‚Äôm by no means the smartest person in the room, and I definitely don‚Äôt feel like I deserve the grades that I‚Äôm somehow pulling out of thin air, but I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty over this.

I grew up poor in a small town with 3 bipolar siblings and a bipolar father. None of my siblings graduated from high school. All 3 went to rehab in some capacity. Only one isn‚Äôt supported by someone else right now. Suffice to say it was rough growing up and I was lumped in with them as never being expected to amount to much.

Fast forward- I graduated top of my class in high school. Via scholarship, a full time job, and student loans I went to a local state school and received my degree cum laude. Landed a great job and a year ago purchased a house with my wife and two dogs.

Today, I went with a colleague to a local country club his family has been a part of for generations. He‚Äôs sponsoring me to become a member.

4343,"So last week I was losing my mind.  I've been negotiating with this potential vendor, and we had a meeting and afterward I didn't hear from them for a few days.  So I'm like, 'look how much of a fuckup I am, that I can't even entice vendors', I was convinced that I'd sounded like an asshat, not knowing what I was talking about.  At the same time, I got pissy with a customer because they were asking about a bunch of asinine stuff, so then I spent two days convinced I was going to get fired for pissing off a customer.  And add to it, my mentor asked how I was doing, and I wrote back this 'fear of failure' thing, and then didn't hear back from him...

So then I spent most of last week just thinking of resigning, no one should have me as an employee, I'll go back to working as a janitor again, etc...

The vendor got back to me, they were dealing with a Covid crisis, they still absolutely want to work with me.  My boss told me that the customer is being a bunch of jerks, and I did right by putting some of the crap back on them.

4382,"Hi all, 


2 years ago got a job at a Fortune 500 company, I previously worked for a small scale startup so this was a huge jump for me. I was excited to start, felt confident that I made it on my first day there! Aaaaand then I started meeting people in my team. Which would go something like this: hey my name is Adam(fiction) I am a software engineer I have a masters I  x and PhD in y I have worked with IBM was awarded <insert achievement here>.  Aaaaand I realised there is a huge change in culture so I had culture shock

With every day it was more and more daunting. I started feeling so small. I used to shame myself and think my accomplishments were not good enough. I would thing that everyone at work were the same age as me which somehow made it much worse. I would not talk in meetings, if someone ask for my opinion I would agree with someone instead of saying anything because I was scared to sound stupid. One day my line manager told me ‚Äúthere were people who did not want to employ you‚Äù and that comment was all I needed to reinforce any beliefs around my incompetence that I had.

From there on out, I started actively avoiding my colleagues. Because I thought the conversation would go either ‚ÄúI think you are an idiot‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are now fired‚Äù. Saying that now seems insane but at that time was so real. Once one of my colleagues invited me to talk to them in a corner booth and I started shaking, because I was convinced  this is the day I am fired and lose everything  (we laugh at this how). In one of the team meetings i said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI am new and I am a recent graduate so this might not be a good idea but...‚Äù. After this, head of my team pulled me aside. 

He noticed my imposter syndrome, he noticed me avoiding people, avoiding expressing myself or saying things in a way that sounds very guarded. He introduced me to his peer who felt the same when she started and this changed my life. 

Finally I had someone to relate to, in the first meeting. she started with talking about her struggles and I just cried for 30 min as I was telling her how I feel worthless, like I am not supposed to be here, like I was hired by mistake or for a quota. She suggested I get a therapist, which is something she had to do as well. 

It took me a year and a few months to overcome this. And it comes back every now and then. However I try to remember a few things that help me feel better :

1. I am here for a reason, I was selected among 100s of people 

2. The work I do is good and important. This is a bit weird but I keep a log of all the thank you emails/messages I get or good outcomes. And when I feel that everything I do is stupid, I read through that to remember it isn‚Äôt 

3. Remember that people have different paths. It‚Äôs silly but since I assume everyone is the same age it seems they are always more accomplished than me. I remember that I am at the start of my career and try to imagine where these people were at the start of their careers 

4. People often don‚Äôt remember the conversations I have with them, so even if I think I said something stupid, chances are they walk away and forget, while I dwell on it for weeks and write scripts in my head to prepare for any future conversations with that person 

5. Rank is not as important as I think, and someone who is my line manager‚Äôs manager is not a celebrity so I should not be scared to talk to them 

6. Everybody starts somewhere, I started tracking what I learned, I look back at it now to see how far I‚Äôve come 

7. (Might be a cultural thing) but it‚Äôs ok to acknowledge my achievements, that does not mean I am bragging

8. I cannot engineer the way people see me

9. Asking questions and talking to people is not a sigh of weakness 

10. Sharing experiences is one of the easiest ways to build relationships",Hi 2 year ago got job Fortune 500 company previously worked small scale startup huge jump excited start felt confident made first day Aaaaand started meeting people team would go something like hey name Adamfiction software engineer master x PhD worked IBM awarded insert achievement Aaaaand realised huge change culture culture shock every day daunting started feeling small used shame think accomplishment good enough would thing everyone work age somehow made much worse would talk meeting someone ask opinion would agree someone instead saying anything scared sound stupid One day line manager told ‚Äú people want employ ‚Äù comment needed reinforce belief around incompetence started actively avoiding colleague thought conversation would go either ‚Äú think idiot ‚Äù ‚Äú fired ‚Äù Saying seems insane time real one colleague invited talk corner booth started shaking convinced day fired lose everything laugh one team meeting said something along line ‚Äú new recent graduate might good idea ‚Äù head team pulled aside noticed imposter syndrome noticed avoiding people avoiding expressing saying thing way sound guarded introduced peer felt started changed life Finally someone relate first meeting started talking struggle cried 30 min telling feel worthless like supposed like hired mistake quota suggested get therapist something well took year month overcome come back every However try remember thing help feel better 1 reason selected among 100 people 2 work good important bit weird keep log thank emailsmessages get good outcome feel everything stupid read remember ‚Äô 3 Remember people different path ‚Äô silly since assume everyone age seems always accomplished remember start career try imagine people start career 4 People often ‚Äô remember conversation even think said something stupid chance walk away forget dwell week write script head prepare future conversation person 5 Rank important think someone line manager ‚Äô manager celebrity scared talk 6 Everybody start somewhere started tracking learned look back see far ‚Äô come 7 Might cultural thing ‚Äô ok acknowledge achievement mean bragging 8 engineer way people see 9 Asking question talking people sigh weakness 10 Sharing experience one easiest way build relationship,trust

4385,"New here. I work in film and theatre, or at least I'm trying to get into that industry as an actor/screenwriter/director. I like to do more than one thing. It's the sort of career where you learn on the job by speaking to other people and working with them. In short, you need to network like a fox. But I can't ask for help. If I did, I would be too terrified to be ridiculed and torn down because it's so obvious that I don't know what I'm doing and I would be exposed as a fraud, a pathetic laughing stock and a failure. But I need to ask for help to learn the skills to do my job. It's a vicious cycle. I grew up in the care system surrounded by narcissistic people and jaded social workers who just wanted to end the conversation and go home for their dinner instead of giving a shit about you or their job. Their favourite word was ""no"". Aiming to achieve anything other than working in a minimum wage job and living in a crap one bedroom flat was discouraged. So I had to go into every single meeting with them every 6-8 weeks feeling armed to the teeth for battle and it was exhausting. If I wanted or needed something I would have to plan an entire TEDx talk to get through it and if they found one single area in my idea that wasn't quite developed yet, they would be like ""AHA!"", and jump right in there to tear me down and keep me under their boot. I was constantly reminded of how I was a stupid little girl living in a fantasy world and had no idea what I was doing or what reality was. They would straight up make fun of you. But they never taught me anything to help me with normal life either because they want you to stay helpless and rely on the system, and then judged me for not having a clue how to do simple things despite it being their responsibility to teach you. You weren't allowed to do anything for yourself (and there were often consequences when you tried to) and then at a certain age, they expected you to just magically be able to do it. So now if I want to do anything at all, even the simplest of things like asking someone how I write a script, I can't. I'm too afraid that the rest of the world is exactly like them. I don't want them to laugh at me if I want to make films and have no idea where to start. If I try to overwhelm myself by doing everything, I fail.

4392,"I am currently undertaking a masters degree in mental health nursing and I am honestly convinced that I am the last person on this planet who should be trying to become a mental health nurse. 
I truly believe that I have 0 people skills and ability to connect with others and make them feel better. I believe that I am nasty and horrible and that it‚Äôs just better for me to shut up than to say anything.
I am so plagued with anxiety that when I do get a chance to speak semi-comfortably I ALWAYS regret what I said because I was slightly more open and less filtered. there are very few people in this world that I trust that I can be genuine with. 
I try my hardest to be genuine, I am good at doing this via my appearance, but other wise I am a completely hidden behind a wall. I am so overly self conscious about how others will perceive me, that I act in such a plain and well thought out manner. I am so scared of not being liked. 
On my last nursing placement at uni I was SOOOO convinced I was going to fail - I thought I was too shy and anxious and didn‚Äôt push myself enough. Turns out I was wrong - the feedback I got from the nurses actually said they would be happy if I can back to work there once I‚Äôm qualified. However I still don‚Äôt really believe it and think they were just being nice.

4402,"This is written very frankly so please excuse my lack of any sugar coating.

I started a company from a young age and saw some immediate success and grew that company. I came from a middle class American family. Over time my parents business really began to take off which made them more money. I had learned of my dads story from the orphanage to running a very successful  company. I would be introduced to others as an aspiring entrepreneur and started living that life. One venture turned into two and then five. I was in over my head with business ideas and opportunities that were funded from money my parents gave me. I felt like didn‚Äôt put the work on to earn the seed money. The paranoia from there Drove me insane and I would
Fight myself 24/7 to not get caught that I was in over my head.  Some companies made money some didn‚Äôt. My last one had me go all in and ask to borrow money. I was conned and now stuck having to pay back every dime and also responsible for over 70 employees who have family‚Äôs and mortgages. Many time I have felt how did i get here and review 1000 what if‚Äôs. But until you hit rock bottom those what ifs mean nothing. There were times on the way I made more money than I could spend and have also lost it all. When you make it, it seems fake and you know stories of orphans who fought in wars and struggled to exist with life and turn into successful people so at times it‚Äôs why me why am I so Fucking special. From what I know I‚Äôve done .01% of the work of others and got here and it makes you feel guilty and afraid others will see you for who you think you are not what you think they see you as. I hope that makes sense.   At the end of that you stand in the mirror, man or woman. And take a deep look because what‚Äôs looking back at you is all you have. If you feel like an imposter than that person on your reflection can change it. Go back to school, pick up a book, interview a professional, take the time to learn to flip the best burger or run all financial
Operations at a specialist manufacturing warehouse. It all falls on you. Don‚Äôt look so much for the quick route there, take your time in the trenches earn the respect for yourself at minimum and WORK your way there. When you realize there is always 1% more I could have done. I could have shipped one more package or read 1 more chapter. Take the time to push yourself, with you putting your time in then you will earn what ever your achievement is yourself. If your homeless and push yourself through school or come from money and parents offer to pay and pave your life. Take the help if it‚Äôs offered, they worked to provide for you and the homeless kid would
Kill for that opportunity. Your parents worked that hard so you don‚Äôt have to live their struggles. But with out those struggles you feel like an imposter. We‚Äôll take any opportunity and seize it, own that shit and multiple it! If your left 1k turn it into 100k use what was left to you, don‚Äôt feel guilty that your situation is different others, just don‚Äôt treat others beneath you. You could have the world by your hands that was given to you and if you feel guilt because you haven‚Äôt earned it, share the opportunity with somebody who has that rage and fire inside to be somebody.   At the end of the day if your in a situation and you are overwhelmed with guilt because you didn‚Äôt earn it, that‚Äôs bullshit you got there from a combo of luck, networking, hard work and skill. The universe decides that‚Äôs where you go so ride it out. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions to learn but the worst you can do is guilt shame yourself into a cocoon and cease to exist, I tried that and lost way too much money. You need to stand tall, proud and Fucking roar like your the king of the jungle and handle YOUR shit!  Imposter syndrome is man made and if we can make it we can break it.  I have faith in you all! Don‚Äôt go down the dark hole there‚Äôs nothing worth seeing there trust me. Take the opportunity you are given and use it as a vessel to take you where you need to be.

4404,"My job ""promoted"" me to a lead role. I told them I wasn't experienced or skilled enough for the role, but they assured me I'm the right choice and that they'd help me grow into that role. 

It's been two months, and imposter syndrome has completely worn me out. It's been really hard. Upper management has stepped in almost whenever I've tried to make decisions which has made me just go to them directly because I feel my decisions are wrong. During meetings with them, I've felt like they are holding back laughter while watching me talk nervously. No matter how many task management apps I use, notes I take, alarms I've created, and post it's I've stuck around my PC, I forget some things and feel terrible. But they didn't hire anyone to take over my old role, so I've been doing that while also being lead so I can't help that I forget some things... I've had to multitask during meetings just to keep up with my workload.  

Today during a meeting, I talked about wanting to make decisions for this important task only for one of the managers to let it slip that I should wait cause they're currently interviewing a guy for literally the lead role they gave me, and that he'd know what to do. My boss then told him to shut up and that now was a bad time to bring it up. I asked them to explain, and he said ""Oh uh yeah [another manager] knows this really talented guy who can help out with our project"". I asked if that means he's replacing me, and he said ""No no, he'll just be sort of helping you."". 

I then asked when this guy is starting, and my boss said ""Oh we actually haven't hired him yet. We're not even sure if he'll join us""... So they want me to wait for someone who hasn't been hired to make decisions on an important task for an undisclosed amount of time than to trust my decisions.  

I was so upset, I spent most of the day crying. Luckily I wfh so I didn't have to be seen, but it was truly an awful day. I'd been wanting to apply elsewhere for a while now and now is probably a good time, but I suddenly feel so humiliated and discouraged that I don't feel like I'd be good enough anywhere.",job promoted lead role told wasnt experienced skilled enough role assured Im right choice theyd help grow role two month imposter syndrome completely worn really hard Upper management stepped almost whenever Ive tried make decision made go directly feel decision wrong meeting Ive felt like holding back laughter watching talk nervously matter many task management apps use note take alarm Ive created post Ive stuck around PC forget thing feel terrible didnt hire anyone take old role Ive also lead cant help forget thing Ive multitask meeting keep workload Today meeting talked wanting make decision important task one manager let slip wait cause theyre currently interviewing guy literally lead role gave hed know bos told shut bad time bring asked explain said Oh uh yeah another manager know really talented guy help project asked mean he replacing said hell sort helping asked guy starting bos said Oh actually havent hired yet even sure hell join u want wait someone hasnt hired make decision important task undisclosed amount time trust decision upset spent day cry Luckily wfh didnt seen truly awful day Id wanting apply elsewhere probably good time suddenly feel humiliated discouraged dont feel like Id good enough anywhere,trust
4406,"The title summarises most of this but basically, I get a lot of compliments from people. Like a lot a lot. I've had friends say they look up to me,  that they respect me, that I have drive and talent and intelligence. But truth be told I'm incredibly...  Mediocre. Not to say there's anything wrong with being average, I don't mind it,  but,  well,  yeah, I'm average. Yet everyone insists I'm not. It's gotten to the point where I assume that it's because of my disability.

Let me explain.
I have severe,  severe tourettes syndrome. For those who don't know it's a neurological condition that makes me have random movements and say random things. A lot of the general public think I'm mentally incapable and will often slow down their talking when they speak to me.

So heres my ""fear"". My disability isn't a setback,  it isnt a hinderance. I've never experienced hardship in my life,  quite frankly I perform the way I do because I'm just an average Joe. But I worry that my friends and lecturers think that my tourettes is some huge barrier or something and or they assume I underperformed not out of incompetence or laziness,  but out of struggle. Every compliment I hear I assume it's just someone feeling bad for my disability. Yet still people describe me to others as intelligent,  multi faceted,  you name it. And I hate it because I wish I was. I wish I was competent and smart and as charismatic as any of my extremely accomplished friends. I just feel ashamed when people with so many accolades Call ME smart or talented.

4410,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.

I was able to apply to a job in a very ideal education setting, in a position I never had the chance at acquiring before graduation, and was asked to an interview. I am qualified.

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

¬∑ Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‚ÄòBecause I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others‚Äô or ‚ÄòI choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other‚Äôs accomplishments‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards‚Äô. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as ‚Äì by its very nature ‚Äì it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‚Äòus‚Äô and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",think ‚Äô belong think ‚Äô good enough ‚Äô fraud getting idea station ‚Äô worthy really Sound familiar Welcome Imposter Syndrome ‚Äô good company Nigella Lawson Michelle Obama Lady GaGa Lily Allen shared imposter syndrome experience publicly demon ‚Äô umbrella term life one limiting belief generalised one may accompanied specific belief typically formed rationally childhood child may serve u well example ¬∑ need everyone approve ¬∑ valued must succeed everything ¬∑ OK make mistake bad ¬∑ feel happy life without contributing back way ¬∑ Everyone need rely someone stronger ¬∑ ‚Äô feel sadness discomfort pain ¬∑ Someone somewhere take responsibility would list look like However time move thing change become adult childhood belief serve u le well ‚Äì resultant behaviour may incongruent situation lead conclusion one thing mean grow develop childhood belief adopt new set belief serve u better adult progression follows broad pattern developing dependence child independence young adult interdependence mature adult overall set belief developing time However u carry childhood belief u adulthood innocuous time sometimes impede performance high functioning interdependent adult adult benefit identifying limiting belief growing valuable belief way example common limiting belief sitting Imposter Syndrome umbrella ‚Äò must compare others ‚Äô reframed ‚Äò live life term ‚Äô ‚Äò unique set character strength others ‚Äô turn reframed belief underpin valuable affirmation ‚Äò live life enjoy success others ‚Äô ‚Äò choose celebrate success without reference ‚Äô accomplishment ‚Äô ‚Äò fact choose live life authentically mean compare standard ‚Äô standard element working PERMA hypnotherapy developing high degree selfawareness via exploring character strength value belief limiting belief pave way defining identity turn leaf ideally placed choose best future Working hypnotherapist particularly well suited personal development area ‚Äì nature ‚Äì open pathway part know recognise ‚Äò u ‚Äô deeper level wisdom ideal need take big step forward,trust
4429,"I hear a lot about Imposter Syndrome in the terms of careers and the workplace but less socially which is something I'm facing. 

I've somehow managed to build this reputation of being a confident, self-assured, sociable guy but inside I feel like I'm really not. Those qualities listed above are what I believe to be the way that people perceive me (based on what they've said and that I've heard) but I don't consider myself any of those things. 

They all assume I'm extroverted and confident, the topic has come up before, but I get socially anxious about speaking up, I stutter a lot, my mind blanks while I speak, I dwell over interactions way after they're done. But somehow, on the outside that doesn't come across. So I start getting treated as a person that I really am not. At times it can make me very uncomfortable and I'm subjected to expectations that I am not able to meet. 

Now, the thing is, I like being perceived this way. It's nice that people think you're self-assured and confident but am I just being a faker? Am I supposed to be true to who I really am or continue a charade.

4430,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling with intrusive and negative thought about myself for more than 4 years now and I just can‚Äôt deal with it no more. I want to reduce my symptoms but I have yet failed to do so. There is a naut in my reasoning and I need to undo but I need help.

So I consider myself pretty lucky. I have good parents, I have always done good at school during childhood. I guess I always had an underlying anxiety issue because at age 15, I could bare a break up and tried (unsuccessfully-thanks lord) to end my life. This depressive period change something in me because I started to put way more importance and attention to my grades. In college, I was often 20% above average in my class, gpa (R score) way above the mean. Yet, I always aimed to get higher, never satisfied. Always giving more than requested in evaluations, making myself almost on the verge of burn out but the adrenaline kept pushing me. In my music recital, I would cry or get mad after my performance because I made mistakes I didn‚Äôt do when rehearsing, my music teacher feeling bad for me. When I did good, I always felt awkward, putting it on chance, trying to hide/deviate the conversation.

Then last year, I got in the undergraduate program I wanted (cognitive neuroscience) and everything got worst. I‚Äôm (now doubting) aiming to enter a PhD program, so does the majority of my 500 classmates, but only 12 places are available. The teachers had to put fire under our ass : ‚Äúgrades are not enough‚Äù, ‚Äúyou need to have above 4/4.3 of gpa, get hundreds of hours in research and clinical experience, win scholarships, publish‚Äù. I got scared, but for real, but I already knew this : before even starting my program I had already contacted researcher to join their lab. Week 2 of my bachelor : I had researcher assistant position. But I felt like a total incompetent and intrude. I never been in a lab in my entire life, didn‚Äôt pass a single exam and I got it almost first shot. So that was both scary and unpleasant. When I went to ask a question on a programming class to my neuroanatomy teacher for my job, he told the entire class (250 persons) that ‚Äúone of your colleagues already had a research job so everyone of you should hurry up because place at PhD are limited‚Äù. The entire class released a surprise ‚Äúahh.. omg‚Äù I was humiliated (my ears turned red), wanted to burry myself 6 feet under. But now I felt the pressure, because my classmate started to recognize me.

1 year later, I got coauthorship for an article published in A famous Journal. I don‚Äôt feel I own it : I feel like an intrude. I didn‚Äôt wrote a single line of it, I was just there to help with the analysis, put comments and correct it. I feel like it was a huge gift from the postdoc and director that mentor me. The article got accepted in first round because he did an incredible work. Not only it is rare to publish as an undergraduate : it is rare to publish it that journal and it is rare that it get accepted first round. I feel uncomfortable. I feel now the bar is set so, so high. Failure is at my door and I‚Äôm scare to disappoint them. My director wants me to prepare a presentation on my ‚Äúperspective on my first redaction experience, and give tips to trainee‚Äù (when I‚Äôm the youngest trainee in the entire team). I legitimately don‚Äôt know what to say: I feel and felt like an intruder for the entire process.

My classmates and colleague relly heavily on me and seem to except that I know everything, but I don‚Äôt. My director gave me a graduate level project to take over and I‚Äôve been freezing for 3 month because I don‚Äôt know how to manage it. I don‚Äôt even know what I want to do of my life anymore but I feel I have to act like I do, at least for being a model to my classmate that don‚Äôt stop asking me question to get to my position. but I have almost no one my age to rely on in return. Mentor already projecting me publicly growing in academia but I feel stupid and so not creative compare to them. I didn‚Äôt do my math (calculus, linear algebra) and now I feel like an handicapped student.

4434,"Maybe it‚Äôs just been a rough week but I just feel like I‚Äôm not cut out to be a tax accountant.

Long story short - I graduated college at the end of 2019 and started my first accounting job out of college at a really small firm, with no previous experience. I prepared mostly personal taxes, a few 1120s and 1065s, and was also involved in bookkeeping. There was minimal training and I really learned what I could from asking questions and just doing the work. I was with them for over 2 1/2 years but decided to leave due to off season stress of not having enough work (if I had no work they wouldn‚Äôt let me study for my CPA either) and the fact I didn‚Äôt see myself being promoted anytime soon (I was the only staff for a good 6 months towards the end).

I decided to go to a mid level firm and accepted a staff roll. I‚Äôve loved it so far and love all the opportunities I‚Äôm being given to work on bigger clients and focus on my weaker areas. However, I feel like coming in with 2 1/2 years I didn‚Äôt expect to have such a learning curve (I definitely knew I would come in with less experience in certain areas) Coming from a state with no income tax, working on mostly individuals, and having no actual formal training other than just on the job has put me at a disadvantage. I feel so dumb compared to other staff. I‚Äôve been put on large clients with multi-state returns, and many things I haven‚Äôt seen before (Which I‚Äôve disclosed). I‚Äôve tried my best to learn; but everything takes me longer, I‚Äôm still perfecting and trying to make my work papers clean, and I feel like I‚Äòm not doing good enough :( During engagement meetings I try and take very detailed notes - but I feel like I always miss something. Or my work papers aren‚Äôt done quite the right way for the reviewer - or I just misunderstand what should be done. I want to ask more questions, but I either feel too stupid or don‚Äôt know what to ask (Like I think I do understand something - when in reality I don‚Äôt) Most of the smaller returns I've worked  on I‚Äôve gotten good feedback on. I haven‚Äôt gotten any bad feedback so far - I can just know that it takes a lot more patience to work with me on bigger projects/ returns right now and certain reviewers probably get frustrated with me. I‚Äôve started to get anxiety while I‚Äôm working again and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm meeting expectations. I don‚Äôt feel like I can turn down work since I still am trying to prove myself and work with a variety of people - I‚Äôve taken maybe 2 actual days of PTO since busy season ended and I‚Äôm just feeling stressed. I‚Äôm just trying to keep pushing through knowing that maybe there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. It‚Äôs so frustrating after being in accounting as a staff for almost 3 1/2 years to feel this way, is accounting even what I want to pursue? Will I ever get better? I really want to be a CPA but I just feel like I‚Äôm too stupid. I feel like all my friends are getting promoted and doing amazing and their jobs just love them. I‚Äôm 25 and I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ever going to be successful :( 

It‚Äôs been a rough year for me with personal tragedy occurring in the middle of busy season as well. I‚Äôm in therapy to work on managing my busy schedule (both personally and at work) as well as work through some childhood trauma.

When I was 18 I got a job as a caregiver for a family member, had a child at 21 and when my family member passed when I was 22 I was out of work for a year. I dropped out of school and never got my GED so I wasn't able to get a job no matter where I applied. 

Eventually, things got so bad I went to DHS for help getting my life on track and they paid for me to get my GED and go to college for medical assisting. Somehow I passed with a 4.0 GPA and got the idea that I'd continue school to become a nurse instead. 3 years, a 3.89 GPA, 108 credits, and an associate in general studies later I finally got into nursing!

I somehow did it all by studying maybe 4 hours a week, if I write what I'm studying with pencil and paper in my own words/understanding, I pretty much have the subject memorized and get between 85% - 99% on my tests.

The problem is that I'm not like everyone else, they have successful parents, and nobody has ever even played a video game or watched anime before. I try to talk about my likes and I get a dead eyed stare from a room of people that I have nothing in common with. I feel like I'm balancing on a house of cards and everyone is going to realize that I'm not smart and counting on my memorization abilities, and that I don't actually fit in.

So I started a new job about 7 weeks ago, it is a complete change of scenery and a male dominated industry but I do enjoy it.
My ex helped me with getting an interview as he knew the SSM who hires the employees.

And although I feel like I have proved myself capable and that I want to pursue a higher career in this industry, I still can‚Äôt help but think because I had help that I do not deserve it.

I have also found out my colleagues have sent a recommendation email to the SSM about me, which helps.

4455,"I'm a 16 year old high school student in Arizona, about to enter my senior year, and I feel so far behind my peers. I feel I'm way too hard on myself, as I currently work a job and I'm ranked #5 in weighted GPA at my high school with a 4.209. That should be enough, right? Although I've tried to tell myself that I've done enough already, I couldn't feel more like a fraud. There are so many points that I could consider when telling myself I am who everyone thinks I am, but my mind comes up with very convincing counterpoints. For example, I achieved the highest ACT score of my class, where it was mandatory for all juniors to take the ACT, yet it was just a 31. Considering a 31 is the BEST ACT score IN THE JUNIOR CLASS, it makes me feel like I'm going to a school of very low academic achievement. This leads into my next point. I was just elected the president of my school's National Honors Society, but I don't feel I deserve it. The members are all extremely lazy, but I hope that changes in Senior year. I have quite a few ideas for improvements we can make to the club next year, but the running was a complete joke. In fact, I was the only student to even run for president, and I've only ever been to one event we held as a club (We''ve only ever had around 4. It was a super bad year for us.) and I hadn't even been to all of the meetings. On top of this, my SAT score is a little disappointing to me. I got a 1410. And I really don't mean for this to sound like a troll post, this is just what my brain keeps telling me. And I understand that in writing this sounds ridiculous, but it's just so rough. I wish I had done more extracurriculars while I could. I haven't done a single sport or other club save NHS and a few days of robotics club at the end of Junior year. This problem really has me considering my future, and fearing I'm going to be a failure. I feel like my GPA means nothing, especially being from one of the lowest ranked states as far as academics go.

4475,"My peers have started to turn their passions into realities. It feels as if more and more people around me are allowing themselves to find open and freeing opportunities for themselves in which they can be successful. And as they let their passions leak into their life, it seems to signify a spark of adulthood in some sense. When I see this, a post on Instagram about a launched website, a conversation about work in a startup company, I feel a tightness in my chest. It almost could be pressure. 

A feeling which is clearly hard to identify in my own self pressures me to take a critical look. Am I a failure already at the age of 20? I don‚Äôt know. My logical brain wants to say, no, of course not. I‚Äôm so young and it's unreasonable for anyone to expect me to already have found my ‚Äúthing‚Äù, a thing which clearly leaks an unstoppable passion into my professional career and shows everyone that I am confident in my life. But my emotional brain starts to say, what are you doing? Why can‚Äôt you be like that? Are you just bound to be unremarkable and will you never find your ‚Äúthing‚Äù?

This brings me to question how people just start companies with some obscure idea that has never been done or heard before. I suggested to a friend this idea that many opportunities that make rich and successful people usually come to them first. I‚Äôm not saying that they don't work for it or they are just lucky. I‚Äôm saying that most of the time, it seems unreasonable to assume everyone who ever had something super successful happen to them made it happen completely on their own. And if so, why can‚Äôt I?

I wish I could just post somewhere and ask, how do I succeed? I‚Äôm a decent college student with a 3.7 GPA, I am the president of my sorority, and I have an internship with a Fortune 500 company this summer. Yet, I still feel lacking. I feel like I am just not the type to succeed. And so I‚Äôve decided that I want to start investigating instead of feeling this pressure in my chest and trying to logically calm myself.

4476,"I've worked in IT for 15 years.  Started as an IT Technician and worked up to IT Manager.  I've never had any formal training or education as everything has been learned on the job or on my own.  That being said I've also been very fortunate in getting work in the IT field.  My first 8 years working in IT was for the same company/people.  My last position with them was as a Systems Admin.  My next 2 jobs were as ""IT Manager"" but I was literally the only one in the department.  I feel that I only got the manager title because of the salary but in these jobs there were no other IT people so there wasn't anyone there who was able to ""test my knowledge"" so to speak.  It really seemed like I was just a sysadmin/helpdesk as I was just keeping the status quo.  

I've recently had some interviews where I was interviewed by folks with real IT knowledge and I bombed miserably.  Simple questions like describe the different kinds of RAID, what's VDI or what's NFS and describe how it works, or what are the different types of backups and what are differences?  This is all pretty basic stuff I assume you learn in school but it's shit I just don't know off the top of my head.  

Raid type?  I've managed infrastructure that's already in place or use RAID 10 because I know it does mirroring and striping.  Is it the best to use in every case? Probably not.

VDI?  I didn't recognize the acronym so instead of asking what the TLA stood for I said i wasn't familiar.  After looking it up I realize that I've worked with Remote Desktop Services and Citrix but I should have known was VDI stood for, I suppose.

NFS is Network File System but I couldn't explain how it works other than we have shares available with files which are restricted by permissions. 

I used the Incremental definition of backups to define Differential and couldn't remember the actual definition of Differential backups.  

Right now I'm working as a sysadmin.  I'm working in an entirely cloud based infrastructure with no on-prem servers supporting multiple locations.  The new IT director (who was hired after I was hired) says he's impressed with what I've doing but I just don't see it.

4477,"I'm (19f) a first year astrophysics undergrad. Back in January, I went around applying to a few summer internships, not expecting to get into them. Most places won't even let first years apply, and the ones who do never hire them. You typically don't do an internship until second year. I just applied because I had nothing to lose, so why not throw in a CV?

This one place I found was doing fascinating research into observational relativity and cosmology, so I applied for an internship. I thought it was an impossibly long shot and expected to get rejected. They asked for my CV, a cover letter, my most recent grades and two references. To be fair, I am relatively accomplished for my age and am very passionate about physics, which I was able to express in the letter. 

I explained to them that while I might be young, I don't shy away from a challenge, as could be seen by the accomplishments on my CV. My two references came from two mentors, one at secondary school and one from uni, who I knew would give me good references. My most recent grades were from my Leaving Cert (final secondary school exams that get you into uni in my country) - I had yet to get my first uni results. They were good results, but it did highlight just how young I am compared to others who might have also applied.

I had forgotten about it and assumed I had been rejected when, about a week ago, I got an email from them with an internship offer. I accepted straight away and was completely elated, but soon I started to wonder how I had pulled it off. This is an esteemed research institution who should have a wide choice of internship applicants. However, the internship was poorly advertised (I had to do some digging to find it myself) and with the global situation as it is, I'm starting to suspect that I may have been the only applicant, or at least one of only a small few. I can't envisage how else I could have possibly gotten the offer.

I said this to my Dad (an engineer with an interest in physics), and he brushed me off straight away, saying I have imposter syndrome. I've felt imposter syndrome before (women in stem feels!) but I'm genuinely baffled at why they would choose someone fresh out of secondary school to join a team researching the gravitational waves of neutron star mergers.

I have my Master's in industrial engineering but I have no clue how to put any of my textbooks to use. Feeling so confused on what to do, and I shouldn't be at all. 

I have to do research on a type of manufacturing process for this as well, because my boss is trusting me to understand how it works. I've just been at home playing Minecraft instead.

And that job just so happens to have me in the most toxic work environment I've yet encountered, which has supercharged my impostor syndrome far beyond its original state because the negative inner voices now have external validation.

4492,"On a different Reddit group reframing came up and I wanted to share. Hopefully, it will add some value to someone. 

One of my professors in school would have me do reframing techniques and keeping a diary. It was a way for me to stop doubting myself so much, realize what I've accomplished and the value I've created.  The process reframed how I looked at some situations and how I looked at myself. 

I recently did this in a roundabout way. I hired someone to do a bio, career history for me for a professional reason. I couldn't see all that I had accomplished myself and was struggling to see myself beyond the tasks I had carried out. As I was working with this person and the questions they asked I realized I needed to reframe again because I had lost sight of my value and validity.

Reframing is a technique that can help us refocus our feelings of inadequacy and create a balanced mental model of how we perceive ourselves or situations. Below is a link to an online interactive app that allows you to reframe.  

Use this to realize failure is a learning opportunity and reaffirm your success, validity, accomplishments, contributions and value. Also if you have other ideas you want a different perspective on this tool can help. I don't know who created it I was just looking for a reframing worksheet and found this instead.

Fast forward to last semester, I changed majors to architecture, as I felt it was a better fit for me. It was more challenging to me in the way where we were constantly reviewing other students work. I was constantly being told what I was doing wrong but also what I can do better. This had a negative affect on me for a couple months but now I am seeing it as constructive. I definitely still feel a competitive challenge with my other classmates, but we are helping each other through it.

4509,"TL;DR: I landed an internship at the highest ranked law firm in my country bc I‚Äôm skilled at taking exams, not because I‚Äôm super smart. Also, my writing skills aren‚Äôt great. I feel like such an impostor and like I‚Äôm going to fail before everyone‚Äôs eyes/get a bad internship-report/grade after my internship ends. Any advice? - Not necessarily looking for life changing solutions (although welcome!), but any advice/tips/words of encouragement or other opinions are appreciated :) 

*edit: the ‚Äòhighest rank firm thing is really not to brag - in my mind it‚Äôs one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt belong there

‚Äî-

Hi, in about 4 months I will start a legal internship that I landed a while ago, but for some reason I‚Äôve been more insecure than ever lately & I‚Äôm having quite some imposter syndrome anxiety about it. 

Reason being, the firm I was hired at is ‚Äòranked‚Äô #1 in my country (for a specific type of law) and everyone who works there has graduated with honors/cum laude. I know grades don‚Äôt always say everything - but let‚Äôs just say very talented people work there. 

How did I get hired for that internship? I think it‚Äôs because, at the time I had my interview, I did have a ‚Äòhonors/cum laude‚Äô grade average and had done many legal extracurricular activities, + my interview went well (I guess).

Now, I‚Äôm not trying to say I‚Äôm absolutely stupid regardless of this, but one of the reasons I feel like an imposter is because I‚Äôm not actually super talented, I‚Äôm just good at ‚Äòtaking exams‚Äô + I spent insane amounts of time prepping for my exams. A second reason is that I‚Äôm neurodivergent and am quite ‚Äòslow‚Äô in understanding things (even if it‚Äôs something simple sometimes), I have bad concentration and can be forgetful. A third reason is that my writing skills aren‚Äôt so good. 

How I perform during this internship and the ‚Äògrade‚Äô I will receive at the end will directly affect my legal job opportunities afterwards, plus, I probably would want to work there permanently if I enjoy the internship. 

I‚Äôm a relatively optimistic person in general and I will try my best either way, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or just has some advice/tips/words of encouragement or anything :)

*extra: due to the high competition and the field, talking to the firm about being neurodivergent is kind of a no-go unfortunately

I just don't wanna be useless or a drain on my family anymore. None of them seem to have similar kinds of issues.

4530,"Hey! So I found this subreddit, I most CERTAINLY have this problem too, and I thought it might prove helpful if I shared some things that have helped me work through this. I hope something of this helps you too.

1. __If you‚Äôre succeeding, even if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the skills,‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing.__ Yea, you do have the skills, but believing that is hard, so take this as an in-between: whatever is causing you to succeed is the functional equivalent of having the necessary skills to do the job. You‚Äôre succeeding. It‚Äôs the same thing. Who cares?! NOBODY, that‚Äôs who!

2. **Other people have seen your skills in action, so they know what you can do better than you do.** It‚Äôs hard to tell internally whether you‚Äôre funny or smart or talented, but if other people all laugh at your jokes and gravitate towards you, or if other people keep coming back to you with their questions, or if other people go to YOU even ONCE to do ANYTHING, clearly you have that skill. You‚Äôre not a good judge of that. You‚Äôre on the wrong side of the window. Analyze other people‚Äôs actions around you and see if that helps.

3. **You have the right to be happy.** It literally hurts NOBODY if you do little things that make you happy. You wanna buy that $5 sweater because it‚Äôs so freaking cute and you have five spare dollars? YES! You like to watch that one obscure tv show that nobody else you know seems to like? Why tf not?! It wouldn‚Äôt be there if *nobody* enjoyed it! It hurts nobody if you listen to music or go for a walk or have one piece of chocolate. There‚Äôs no downside. Even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it or supposedly don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs a net neutral either way. It has no effect. Start doing things with no purpose sometimes, you‚Äôll get used to it. No reason to stress about something that has no impact on anything- we can get around the problem this way. Ninja dodge!

4. **Keep track of what makes you happy.** I don‚Äôt know if this helps specifically with this, since I have various other mental issues, so I‚Äôll keep it shorter. I have a paper on my wall next to my desk and bed with columns labeled from 1 to 5 stars. At the end of every day, right before I go to sleep, I rate the quality of my day based on how I feel. Using this system has multiple benefits, namely that I remember and acknowledge my good days more and I can keep track of which major life adjustments have what effect. For instance, when the college semester started back up and I was able to do things again, go outside, have purpose... my days went from being mostly 2-4 because they were all numb and blending together, to being 3-5 because I was able to have pride that I accomplished something or able to enjoy an experience that I had. I‚Äôve also noticed that overall, I rate my days higher when I‚Äôve been productive. This actually helps me be productive because there‚Äôs a more tangible motivator- ‚ÄòI really want to have a good day, and it‚Äôs statistically much more likely if I‚Äôm productive.‚Äô Try it if you‚Äôd like. Idk. I didn‚Äôt keep this short like I said I would. Sorry.

5. **It ain‚Äôt real.** The most commonly known one. If you can manage to identify it in your mind whenever it‚Äôs happening, that‚Äôs a fantastic help. It‚Äôs even better when/if you‚Äôre able to completely cast it out as illogical and move on. Now, I‚Äôm rarely able to get rid of it that way of course, but sometimes it helps make it less bad. Make a habit of this. Consistency is key and will help you identify the feelings when and sometimes before they show up, since you‚Äôll recognize a situation as a trigger for you. 

Good luck everyone! I love you all and hope these were mildly helpful.  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£
